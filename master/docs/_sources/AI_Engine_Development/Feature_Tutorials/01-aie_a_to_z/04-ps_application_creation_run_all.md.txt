## Introduction

In this section of the tutorial, you will learn how to build a PS bare-metal application using the XSA created in the previous step and then build and run the complete system.

### Step 1. Create a New Platform in the Bare-metal Domain

1. Open the Vitis softwware platform 2020.2 in the same workspace directory as the previous step. Click ***File → New →  Platform Project***.

2. Set the Platform Project Name to ***AIE_A-to-Z_pfm_vck190*** and click ***Next***.

3. Use the XSA generated in the previous step that you can find in `workspace/simple_application_system_hw_link/Hardware/binary_container_1.xsa` and set ***standalone*** as ***Operating system*** and ***psv_cortexa72_0*** as ***Processor*** and click ***Finish***.

4. Build the platform.

### Step 2. Build the Baremetal AI Engine Control Application

1. Create a new application by clicking on ***New > Application Project***.

2. Select ***AIE_A-to-Z_pfm_vck190*** as the platform.

3. Set the name for the application (example `A-to-Z_app`) and select the A72_0 processor domain (`psv_cortexa72_0`) and click ***Next***.

4. On the next page, select ***standalone*** for the ***domain***.

5. Finally, select the ***Empty Application (C++)*** template and click ***Finish***.

6. Right-click on the ***src*** folder under the ***A-to-Z_app*** project and click ***Import Sources***.

7. Import the `aie_control.cpp` file from the AI Engine application project (`simple_application/Hardware/Work/ps/c_rts/aie_control.cpp`).

8. Import the following source files from the `src` folder
* `main.cpp`
* `platform.cpp`
* `platform.h`
* `platform_config.h`

    ![](images/ps_app_import.png)

Go through the `main.cpp` file. You can see that the code is initializing the input data and the memory space for the output data. One thing to note is the use of the `.init()` and `.run()` APIs to control the AI Engine.

```
printf("Starting AIE Graph\n");
printf("Graph Initialization\n");
mygraph.init();
printf("Done \n");
printf("- \n");

printf("Running Graph for 4 iterations\n");
mygraph.run(4);
```

There are two options to enable an AI Engine graph from a system:
* Enable the graph in the PDI. This means that the graph will be started during BOOT and will run forever.
* Enable the AI Engine graph from the PS program using `<graph>.init()` and `<graph>.run()` APIs. This is what we are using in this case.

9. Right click on A72 PS application (`A-to-Z_app)` and select ***c/c++ Build Settings***.

10. In the Directories section under ARM v8 g++ compiler, add the directory for the AI Engine application:

  a. `${XILINX_VITIS_AIETOOLS}/../include`

  b. The sources folder for the AI Engine application (`${workspace_loc:/simple_application/src}`)

  ![](images/ps_app_cfg2.png)

11. When the PS is enabling the AI Engine graph as it is in this example, you also need to use the symbol ***_ _ PS_ENABLE_AIE_ _***.
In the Symbols section under ARM v8 g++ compiler, add the symbol ***__PS_ENABLE_AIE _ _***.

12. Build the A72 PS application (`A-to-Z_app`) .     

### Step 3. Build the Full System

1. Click ***simple_application_system.sprj***. Add the following options in the Packaging option box:

```
--package.ps_elf ../../A-to-Z_app/Debug/A-to-Z_app.elf,a72-0  --package.defer_aie_run
```

  ![](images/package_option.png)

>**Note**: The option  `--package.defer_aie_run` is required when running the AI Engine graph from the PS (see the [Versal ACAP AI Engine Programming Environment User Guide (UG1076)](https://www.xilinx.com/cgi-bin/docs/rdoc?t=vitis+doc;v=2020.2;d=yii1603912637443.html)).

2. Build the ***simple_application_system*** project.


### Step 4. Run the System

1. Make sure your VCK190 board is connected to your PC.

2. Right-click on the ***simple_application_system*** and click ***Run As > Launch Hardware***.

3. You should see the application running successfully with no error.

## Summary

In this tutorial, you have performed an end-to-end flow to create a platform based on the VCK190 board, added an AI Engine kernel and PL kernels into the system, and built a PS bare-metal application to run on it.
