## Overview

We've made some big gains in our overall system throughput, but the bottleneck is now very clearly the
accelerator itself.  Remember that there are two axes on which we can optimize a design: we can throw more
resources at a problem to solve it faster, which is bound by **Amdahl's Law**, or we can do more fundamental
operations in parallel following **Gustafson's Law**.

In this case we'll try optimizing along the axis of Amdahl's Law. Up until now our accelerator has been
following basically the same algorithm as the CPU, performing one 32-bit addition on each clock tick.  But,
because the CPU has a significantly faster clock (and has the advantage of not having to transfer the data
over PCIe) it's always been able to beat us.  Now it's time to turn the tables.

Our DDR controller natively has a 512-bit wide interface internally.  If we parallelize the data flow in the
accelerator, that means we'll be able to process 16 array elements per clock tick instead of one. So, we
should be able to get an instant 16x speed-up by just vectorizing the input.

## Key Code

In this example, if we continue to focus on the host software and treat the kernel as a black box we wind up
with code that's essentially identical to the code from Example 3.  All we need to do is change the kernel
name from `vadd` to `wide_vadd`.

Since the code is the same, this is a good opportunity to introduce another concept of working with memory in
XRT and OpenCL.  On the Alveo Data Center accelerator cards we have four memory banks available, and while it
isn't necessary with these simple accelerators you may find that you wish to spread operations among them to
help maximize the bandwidth available to each of the interfaces.  For our simple vector addition example,
just for illustration purposes we've used the topology shown here:

![Wide VADD Memory Connectivity](./images/04_parallizing_the_data_path.jpg)

What we gain by doing this is the ability to perform high-bandwidth transactions simultaneously with different external memory banks.  Remember, long bursts are generally better for performance than many small reads and writes, but you can't fundamentally perform two operations on the memory at the same time.

It's easy enough to specify the hardware connectivity via command line switches, but when we want to actually transfer buffers down to the hardware we need to specify which memories to use for XRT.  Xilinx accomplishes this by way of an extension to the standard OpenCL library, using a struct `cl_mem_ext_ptr_t` in combination with the buffer allocation flag `CL_MEM_EXT_PTR_XILINX`.  In the code that looks like this:

```cpp
// Declare physical memory bank connectivity
cl_mem_ext_ptr_t bank1_ext, bank2_ext;
bank2_ext.flags = 2 | XCL_MEM_TOPOLOGY;
bank2_ext.obj   = NULL;
bank2_ext.param = 0;
bank1_ext.flags = 1 | XCL_MEM_TOPOLOGY;
bank1_ext.obj   = NULL;
bank1_ext.param = 0;

// Allocate buffers
cl::Buffer a_buf(context,
                 static_cast<cl_mem_flags>(CL_MEM_READ_ONLY |
                                           CL_MEM_EXT_PTR_XILINX),
                 BUFSIZE*sizeof(uint32_t),
                 &bank1_ext,
                 NULL);
cl::Bufferb_buf(context,
                 static_cast<cl_mem_flags>(CL_MEM_READ_ONLY |
                                           CL_MEM_EXT_PTR_XILINX),
                 BUFSIZE*sizeof(uint32_t),
                 &bank2_ext,
                 NULL);
cl::Buffer c_buf(context,
                 static_cast<cl_mem_flags>(CL_MEM_READ_WRITE |
                                           CL_MEM_EXT_PTR_XILINX),
                 BUFSIZE*sizeof(uint32_t),
                 &bank1_ext,
                 NULL);
```

You can see that this code is very similar to the previous example, with the difference being that we're
passing our `cl_mem_ext_ptr_t` object to the `cl::Buffer` constructor and are using the flags field to
specify the memory bank we need to use for that particular buffer.  Note again that there is fundamentally no
reason for us to do this for such a simple example, but since this example is so structurally similar to the
previous one it seemed like a good time to mix it in.  This can be a very useful technique for performance
optimization for very heavy workloads.

Otherwise, aside from switching to the `wide_vadd` kernel the code here is exactly unchanged other than
increasing the buffer size to 1 GiB.  This was done to better accentuate the differences between the hardware
and software.

## Running the Application

With the XRT initialized, run the application by running the following command from the build directory:

`./04_wide_vadd alveo_examples`

The program will output a message similar to this:

Mission accomplished - we've managed to beat the CPU!

There are a couple of interesting bits here, though.  The first thing to notice is that, as you probably
expected, the time required to transfer that data into and out of the FPGA hasn't changed.  Like we disussed
in earlier sections, that's effectively a fixed time based on your memory topology, amount of data, and
overall system memory bandwidth utilization.  You'll see some minor run-to-run variability here, especially
in a virtualized environment like a cloud data center, but for the most part you can treat it like a
fixed-time operation.

The more interesting one, though, is the achieved speedup.  You might be surprised to see that widening the
data path to 16 words per clock did not, in fact, result in a 16x speedup.  The kernel itself processes 16
words per clock, but what we're seeing in the timed results is a cumulative effect of the external DDR
latency.  Each interface will burst in data, process it, and burst it out.  But the inherent latency of going
back and forth to DDR slows things down and we only actually achieve a 10x speedup over the single-word
implementation.

Unfortunately, we're hitting a fundamental problem with vector addition: it's too easy.  The computational
complexity of vadd is O(N), and a very simpleO(N) at that.  As a result you very quickly become I/O bandwidth
bound, not computation bound.  With more complex algorithms, such as nested loops which are O(Nx) or even
computationally complex O(N) algorithms like filters needing lots of calculations, we can achieve
significantly higher acceleration by performing more computation inside the FPGA fabric instead of going out
to the memory quite so often.  The best candidate algorithms for acceleration have very little data transfer
and lots of calculations.

We can also run another experiment with a larger buffer.  Change the buffer size:

```cpp
#define BUFSIZE (1024*1024*256)// 256*sizeof(uint32_t) = 1 GiB
```

Rebuild and run it again, and now let's switch over to a simplified set of metrics as in the table below.  I
think you get the idea on OpenCL initialization by now, too, so we'll only compare the algorithm's
performance.  That doesn't mean that this initialization time isn't important, but you should architect your
application so it's a one-time cost that you pay during other initialization operations.

We will also stop tracking the buffer allocation and initialization times.  Again this is something that
you'd generally want to do when setting up your application.  If you're routinely allocating large buffers in
the critical path of your application, odds are you'd get more "bang for your buck" rethinking your
architecture rather than trying to apply hardware acceleration.

| Operation             |  Example 4  |
| --------------------- | :---------: |
| Software VADD         | 820.596 ms  |
| Buffer PCIe TX        | 383.907 ms  |
| VADD Kernel           | 484.050 ms  |
| Buffer PCIe RX        | 316.825 ms  |
| Hardware VADD (Total) | 1184.897 ms |
| &Delta;Alveo&rarr;CPU | 364.186 ms  |

Oh no!  We had such a good thing going, and here we went and ruined it.  With this larger buffer we're not beating the CPU anymore at all.  What happened?

Looking closely at the numbers, we can see that while the hardware kernel itself is processing the data pretty efficiently, the data transfer to and from the FPGA is really eating up a lot of our time.  In fact, if you were to draw out our overall execution timeline, it would look something like figure 3.4 at this point.

![Kernel Execution Timeline](./images/04_kernel_execution_time.jpg)

This chart is figurative, but to relative scale.  Looking closely at the numbers, we see that in order to
beat the CPU our entire kernel would need to run to completion in only about 120 ms.  For that to work we
would need to run four times faster (not likely), process four times as much data per clock, or run four
accelerators in parallel. Which one should we pick?  Let's leave that for the next example.

## Extra Exercises

Some things to try to build on this experiment:

- Play around with the buffer sizes again.  Can you find the inflection point where the CPU becomes faster?
- Try to capture the Vitis Timeline Trace and view this for yourself.  The instructions for doing so are
  found in the [Vitis Documentation](https://www.xilinx.com/html_docs/xilinx_2020_1/vitis_doc/index.html)

## Key Takeaways


- Parallelizing the kernel can provide great results, but you need to take care that your data transfer
  doesn't start to dominate your execution time.  Or if it does, that you stay under your target execution
  time.

- Simple computation isn't always a good candidate for acceleration, unless you're trying to free up the
  processor to work on other tasks.  Better candidates for acceleration are complex workloads with high
  complexity, especially O(Nx) algorithms like nested loops, etc.
- If you have to wait for all of the data to transfer before you begin processing you may have trouble
  hitting your overall performance target even if your kernels are highly optimized.

Now we've seen that just parallelizing the data path isn't quite enough.  Let's see what we can do about
those transfer times.
