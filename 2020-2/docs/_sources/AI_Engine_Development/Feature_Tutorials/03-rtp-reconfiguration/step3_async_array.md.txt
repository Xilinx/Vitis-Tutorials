## Asynchronous Update of Array RTP
This step demonstrates how runtime array parameters can be passed to kernels. You will change the filter coefficient at runtime and observe the result. The system to be implemented is as follows.

__Note: The default working directory in this step is "step3", unless specified explicitly.__  

### Review Graph and RTP Code
`aie/fir24_sym_param.h`gives a forward declaration of a 24-tap symmetric FIR filter:

	void fir24_sym (input_window_cint16 * iwin, output_window_cint16 * owin, const int32(&coeffs)[12]);
	
The filter has an input and output window which consumes and produces complex samples. This filter differs from previous filters you have seen because the coefficients of the filter can be set as a kernel parameter and changed on each invocation. The implementation of the filter is in `aie/kernels/hb24.cc`.

The `aie/hls` directory contains a kernel that generates samples of random noise. The noise generator is implemented as a programmable logic (PL) block inside graph, with samples consumed by the filter: 

	extern "C" void random_noise(hls::stream<std::complex<short> > & out) {
	#pragma HLS INTERFACE axis port=out
	#pragma HLS INTERFACE ap_ctrl_none port=return
	
The PL kernel has two `#pragma` specified for vitis HLS. `#pragma HLS INTERFACE axis port=out` indicates that port "`out`" will be implemented with AXI4-Stream interface, while `#pragma HLS INTERFACE ap_ctrl_none port=return` indicates that the kernel has no block control signals (i.e., it is a free-running kernel). Free-running means that the kernel will keep running after the FPGA has been configured, the clock has been activated, and the reset is deactivated. The execution of a free-running kernel depends on the availability of input data, or readiness of a receiving buffer. It does not require explicit control in the host code when running aiesimulator, HW emulation and HW flows.

`aie/graph.h` has constraints to place the kernel in PL:
	
	using namespace adf；
	...
	noisegen = kernel::create(random_noise);
	fabric<pl>(noisegen);

The filter coefficients are given in:

   * `data/narrow_filter.txt` (with a normalized bandwidth of 0.3 pi)

   * `data/wide_filter.txt` (with a normalized bandwidth of 0.8 pi)

Examine `aie/graph.h` again. Notice the code to connect the coefficients input port of the graph to the `coeffs` parameter of the filter kernel. This should be specified as an asynchronous runtime parameter (with adf::async). 

	// connect filter coefficients
	connect< parameter >(coefficients, async(fir24.in[1]));
	
Check `aie/graph.cpp`. Examine the code to update the coefficients using `narrow_filter` in the ping buffer for 16 iterations.
Then update the coefficients using `wide_filter` in the pong buffer for another 16 iterations. Note that `graph.cpp` specifies the `narrow_filter` and `wide_filter` coefficients in `int` arrays based on the data in the filter files.

	//run for 16 iterations, update narrow filter coefficients, wait, update wide filter coefficients, run for 16 iterations
	gr.update(gr.coefficients, narrow_filter, 12);
	gr.run(16); 
	gr.wait();
	gr.update(gr.coefficients, wide_filter, 12);
	gr.run(16); 
	
In this snippet, the first graph update call initializes the coefficients parameter using the `narrow_filter` with 12 elements for the first 16 iterations. The `wait()` is blocking, and forces the execution to wait until the first 16 iterations finish. Subsequently, the next update call initializes the coefficients parameter using `wide_filter` with 12 elements for the next 16 iterations. The number of iterations are specified as a parameter to the `run()` API. Note that `update()` has a third parameter that speicfies the size of the array to be updated.

### Run the AI Engine compiler and AI Engine simulator 
Compile the AI Engine graph (`libadf.a`) using the AI Engine compiler:
	
	make aie
	
After the AI Engine graph (`libadf.a`) has been generated, verify for correctness using the AI Engine simulator:
	
	make aiesim
	
After simulation completes, you should see `output.txt` under `aiesimulator_output/data`. You can compare `output.txt` with the golden reference in `data/golden.txt` using the following commands in command line:
	
	grep -v T aiesimulator_output/data/output.txt > aiesimulator_output/data/output_data.txt
	diff -w aiesimulator_output/data/output_data.txt ./data/golden.txt

If you have MATLAB or Octave, you can use the following script to visualize the data:

	data=load('./aiesimulator_output/data/output_data.txt', '-ascii');
	cxdata = data(:,1) + data(:,2)*i;
	narrow_spectrum = 20*log10(abs(fftshift(fft(cxdata(1:1024)))));
	wide_spectrum = 20*log10(abs(fftshift(fft(cxdata(1025:2048)))));
	plot(narrow_spectrum);
![](./images/figure5.PNG)
	plot(wide_spectrum);
![](./images/figure6.PNG)	

### Run Hardware Emulation and Hardware flow
PL kernels inside graph still need to be compiled into Xilinx object (`.xo`) files. You can run a make command to compile it:
	
	make -C aie/hls
	
The corresponding v++ -c command is:
	
	v++ -c --platform xilinx_vck190_base_202010_1 -k random_noise random_noise.cpp -o random_noise.xo --verbose --save-temps
	
Using the v++ linker (`-l`) command, you are *not* required to specify connections for PL kernels inside the graph, because the connection information is already included in the `libadf.a` file.

The Makefile rule targets introduced in [Synchronous update of scalar RTP](./step1_sync_scalar.md) and [Asynchronous update of scalar RTP](./step2_async_scalar.md) still apply here. Details about tool options and host code in [Synchronous update of scalar RTP](./step1_sync_scalar.md) are similar. However, you can just choose to run following make command to launch HW emulation:

	make run_hw_emu
	
And in the Linux prompt, run the following commands:

	mount /dev/mmcblk0p1 /mnt
	cd /mnt
	export XILINX_XRT=/usr
	export XCL_EMULATION_MODE=hw_emu
	./host.exe a.xclbin
	
To exit QEMU press Ctrl+A, x. 

For hw mode, run following make command to generate an SD card package:
	
	make package TARGET=hw
	
And in hardware, after booting Linux from the SD card, run following commands in the Linux prompt:

	export XILINX_XRT=/usr
	cd /mnt/sd-mmcblk0p1
	./host.exe a.xclbin
	
The host code is self-checking. It will check the output data against the golden data. If the output matches the golden data, after the run is complete, it will print the following:

	TEST PASSED
	
### Conclusion
In this step you learned about:

   * the concepts of asynchronous update of array RTP
   * How to control the execution between different RTP updates
   * Free-running PL kernel inside graph
