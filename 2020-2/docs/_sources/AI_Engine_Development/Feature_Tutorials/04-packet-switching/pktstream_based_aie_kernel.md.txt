## Packet Stream Based AI Engine Kernels
Packet Stream-based AI Engine kernels allow fine-grain control over how packets are generated and consumed in the kernels. This section explains how to code AI Engine kernels with packet stream interfaces (`input_pktstream` and `output_pktstream`). The connection in the graph is also described. 

The PL side and PS side of this example is the same as [Window Based AI Engine Kernels](./window_based_aie_kernel.md). Please refer to:
* [Packet Format](./window_based_aie_kernel.md/#Packet-Format)
* [Example PL Kernels for Packet Switching](./window_based_aie_kernel.md/#Example-PL-Kernels-for-Packet-Switching)
* [Example PS code for Packet Switching](./window_based_aie_kernel.md/#Example-PS-code-for-Packet-Switching)

### Packet Stream Interfaces and Operations
Two stream types are provided to denote streaming data, consisting of packetized interleaving of several different streams. These types are listed in the following table:

Input Stream Types | Output Stream Types
------------ | -------------
input_pktstream | output_pktstream

A data packet consists of a one word (32-bit) packet header, followed by some number of data words where the last data word has the TLAST field denoting the end-of-packet. The following operations are used to read and advance input packet streams and write and advance output packet streams.

    int32 readincr(input_pktstream *w);
    int32 readincr(input_pktstream *w, bool &tlast);
    void writeincr(output_pktstream *w, int32 value);
    void writeincr(output_pktstream *w, int32 value, bool tlast);

The API with the `TLAST` argument helps to read or write the end-of-packet condition if the packet size is not fixed.

The AI Engine tools provide built-in function `generateHeader` to generate packet header for packets originating from the AI Engine kernel. 

    uint32_t generateHeader(unsigned int pcktType, unsigned int ID);

The AI Engine tools also provide the built-in function `getPacketid` to get the packet ID for the packet stream interface. The index for `getPacketid` only applies if the packet stream feeds into a `pktsplit`. In this example, each AI Engine kernel output sees only one logical stream (0 for index).

    uint32_t getPacketid(input_pktstream * in, int index);
    uint32_t getPacketid(output_pktstream * out, int index);   
    
Change working directory to `pktstream_aie`. Review the AI Engine kernels (`aie/aie_core1.cpp`, ... , `aie/aie_core4.cpp`). The code for `aie_core1` (`aie/aie_core1.cpp`) is:

    #include <adf.h>
    const uint32 pktType=0;

    void aie_core1(input_pktstream *in,output_pktstream *out){
      readincr(in);//read header and discard
      uint32 ID=getPacketid(out,0);//for output pktstream
      uint32 header=generateHeader(pktType,ID); //Generate header for output
      writeincr(out,header);

      bool tlast;
      for(int i=0;i<8;i++){
        int32 tmp=readincr(in,tlast);
        tmp+=1;
        writeincr(out,tmp,i==7);//TLAST=1 for last word
      }
    }

It can be seen that the input packet header is discarded. The output header is generated by `generateHeader`, and the packet ID for the header is obtained by `getPacketid`. `TLAST` equals 1 for the last word in the packet.

### Construct Graph for Packet Stream Kernels
Review how the graph is constructed in `aie/graph.h`. 

    #include <adf.h>
    #include "kernels.h"
    class mygraph: public adf::graph {
    private:
      adf:: kernel core[4];
      adf:: pktsplit<4> sp;
      adf:: pktmerge<4> mg;
    public:
      adf::port<input>  in;
      adf::port<output>  out;
      mygraph() {
        core[0] = adf::kernel::create(aie_core1);
        core[1] = adf::kernel::create(aie_core2);
        core[2] = adf::kernel::create(aie_core3);
        core[3] = adf::kernel::create(aie_core4);
        adf::source(core[0]) = "aie_core1.cpp";
        adf::source(core[1]) = "aie_core2.cpp";
        adf::source(core[2]) = "aie_core3.cpp";
        adf::source(core[3]) = "aie_core4.cpp";

        sp = adf::pktsplit<4>::create();
        mg = adf::pktmerge<4>::create();
        for(int i=0;i<4;i++){
          adf::runtime<ratio>(core[i]) = 0.9;
          adf::connect<adf::pktstream > (sp.out[i], core[i].in[0]);
          adf::connect<adf::pktstream > (core[i].out[0], mg.in[i]);
        }
        adf::connect<adf::pktstream> (in, sp.in[0]);
        adf::connect<adf::pktstream> (mg.out[0], out);
      }
    };

Note that the connection type for the `input_pktstream` and `output_pktstream` interfaces are `adf::pktstream`. So, it uses `adf::connect<adf::pktstream>` to connect the AI Engine kernel and `pktsplit.out` / `pktmerge.in`. 

### Run AI Engine Simulator, HW Emulation, and HW flows
Run AI Engine simulator with the following make command:

    make aiesim
    
Run HW emulation with the following make command(it will build HW system and host application) :

    make run_hw_emu
    
Hint: If the keyboard is accidentally hit and stops the system booting automatically, type boot at the **Versal>** prompt to resume the system booting.

After Linux has booted, run following commands in Linux prompt (this is only for HW cosim):

    mount /dev/mmcblk0p1 /mnt
    cd /mnt
    export XILINX_XRT=/usr
    export XCL_EMULATION_MODE=hw_emu
    ./host.exe a.xclbin
    
To exit QEMU press Ctrl+A, x

To run in hardware, first build the system and application using the following make command:

    make package TARGET=hw
    
After Linux has booted, run the following commands at the Linux prompt:

    export XILINX_XRT=/usr
    cd /mnt/sd-mmcblk0p1
    ./host.exe a.xclbin
    
The host code is self-checking. It will check the correctness of output data. If the output data is correct, after the run has completed, it will print:

    TEST PASSED
