Executing `main` to functionaly verify the `tsp` function.

## Run the Vitis HLS C Simulation

As discussed, the testbench file is visible on the left hand side of the Vitis HLS GUI, from the *Explorer* pane: `proj->TestBench` with the file `tsp_TB.cpp`. 
Inside the tesbench we see that city coordinates are converted to distances.
City coordinates:
```cpp
  const Coord cities[] = {{40.7127837, -74.0059413 },
                          {34.0522342, -118.2436849},
                          {41.8781136, -87.6297982 },
                          {29.7604267, -95.3698028 },
                          ...
```
Calculation for distances (as previously discussed, these numbers are normalized to integers before feeding them into the `tsp` accelerator function):
```cpp
float dist = std::sqrt(
                       std::pow(cities[i].x-cities[j].x, 2)
                     + std::pow(cities[i].y-cities[j].y, 2)
                      );
```

The testbench sends 16-bit (`uint16_t`) data types transcoded from floating-point for efficient hardware processing: 
```cpp
// Normalizing distances to get the maximum precision on 16-bit integers
uint16_t maxUint = std::numeric_limits<uint16_t>::max();
for ( int i = 0; i < N*N; ++i ) {
  cout << "Distance (fp32): " << distances[i] << " Norm. (uint16): " << (uint16_t)((distances[i]/maxDist) * maxUint);
  inputDistances.write((distances[i]/maxDist) * maxUint);
}
```

Before running the simulation open the `tsp.h` file and examine the number of cities (`N=5`). To begin with you will use only a few cities to allow simulation to complete quickly. In the next lab you will set the number of cities to 13 for synthesis. You can open the `tsp.h` file in the Vitis HLS GUI from the `tsp.cpp` file by holding the mouse over the `#include "tsp.h"` line and press CTRL key while clicking the mouse. 

*IMPORTANT: Reducing the value of N for simulation is important, or your simulations will take considerable time to run*

To run the simulation from the Vitis HLS GUI, point to the upper toolbar of the Vitis HLS GUI, locate the green 'play' icon 
![play](./images/play.png "Title")
and from its drop-down menu, select **C simulation**:

You can also alternatively use the main menu: `Project` -> `Run C Simulation`  
Once the C simulation dialog comes up, simple click OK.  
After the C simulation, the Vitis HLS GUI will look like this:

![Csim screen](./images/csim.png)

As we see on the screenshot above, the result is 75662 (scaled integer) or 51.6494. It matches the pre-computed result stored in the testbench.
