    See AMD Vitis™ Development Environment on `xilinx.com <https://www.xilinx.com/products/design-tools/vitis.html>`_



The tutorials under the Hardware Acceleration category help you learn how to use the Vitis core development kit to build, analyze, and optimize an accelerated algorithm developed in C++, OpenCL, and even low-level hardware description languages (HDLs) like Verilog and VHDL. You may also learn how to optimize the CPU side of your application for efficient memory allocation, how to sequence system-level events, and more. 

* The :doc:`Feature Tutorials <./docs/Feature_Tutorials/Feature_Tutorials>` illustrate specific features or flows of Vitis, some features may not be required by all designs but are still useful for some use cases.
* The :doc:`Design Tutorials <./docs/Design_Tutorials/Design_Tutorials>` illustrate higher-level concepts or design flows, walk through specific examples or reference designs, and more complex and complete designs or applications.

These tutorials target different boards including AMD Alveo™ Data Center acceleration cards or MPSoC Evaluation Boards like ZCU104. The table below lists the tutorials available, and the features and flows showcased in all of these tutorials. The various columns correspond to specific features/flows supported in these tutorials and will help you identify tutorials that showcase specific flows and features that you are interested in.
