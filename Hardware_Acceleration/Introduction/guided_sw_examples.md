## Provided Design Files

In the installation package for this tutorial series you will find a `design_source` directory.
This directory contains all of the source files necessary to build and run the examples (with the exception of
the build tools such as Vitis, XRT, and the target development platform, which you must install yourself).

Under the design_source directory, there are two primary directories: `hw_src` and `sw_src`.  As the names
imply, these contain the hardware and software source files for our application.  The hardware sources
synthesize to algorithms that run on the FPGA through the Vitis **V++** compiler, and the software sources are
compiled using standard GCC to run on the host processor.

We are focusing on software more than hardware in this tutorial, so we have split the source files for easy
organization.  In a real project any directory structures, etc. are arbitrary; you can follow the best
practices of your team or organization.

Because some of the examples rely on external libraries, we are using the **CMake** build system for the
software examples as it simplifies environment configuration.  But on the hardware side, we're using standard
**make**. This is so you can easily see the command line arguments passed to V++.

## Hardware Design Setup

This guided introduction will introduce acceleration concepts targeting the Alveo cards.  While not explicitly
covered in this release, the concepts, techniques, and relative performance apply equally well to embedded
processors also. We'll start with writing host code: programming the FPGA, allocating memory, and moving
memory around.  Our accelerators will be very simple for these early examples.  In fact, we'll likely see that
the algorithms run faster on the CPU, at least at first, since our acceleration hardware is so trivial.

Building hardware designs can also be quite time-consuming - it turns out that synthesizing, placing, and
routing custom logic across billions of transistors with sub-nanosecond timing is just a teeny bit more
complex than compiling to machine code.  Bear with us, because the results are worth it.  To avoid having to
needlessly rebuild the FPGA hardware, we provide a single FPGA design with many kernel instances, which we'll
mix-and-match as needed for the example designs.  This guide will touch a bit on kernel optimization, but
beyond basic concepts, we'll mostly leave that for other tutorials in this repository.

This onboarding example comes with a hardware image targeting the Alveo U200 accelerator card with shell
version 201830_2. You'll need to build the hardware design before you can run. To do that, change into the
directory:

```
Vitis-In-Depth-Tutorial/Runtime_and_System_Optimization/Introduction/design_src/hw_src
```

If you have a different version of the target platform installed on your board, you can skip this step.  But if you are targeting a platform other than the Alveo U200, open the Makefile and change the first line to point to your platform?s .xpfm file.

_**Note:** Line breaks may have been added to the example below for formatting, depending on your resolution.
Do not add line breaks to the path in your Makefile._

```make
PLATFORM := /opt/xilinx/platforms/xilinx_u200_xdma_201830_1/xilinx_u200_xdma_201830_1.xpfm
```

Once you edit the Makefile, ensure that your Vitis and XRT environments are set up properly.  If you have not
done so already, run the commands:

```bash
source /opt/Xilinx/Vitis/2020.1/settings.sh
source /opt/xilinx/xrt/setup.sh
```

If your installation path for either XRT or Vitis are different than the default locations, update the command
line accordingly. Then, run the command:

`make`

The build process will take some time, but in the end you will have a file in this directory called
**alveo_examples.xclbin**.  This file contains all of the kernels we will use during this exercise.  Once you
have this file compiled for your combination of board and shell, you are ready to proceed to the next section.
