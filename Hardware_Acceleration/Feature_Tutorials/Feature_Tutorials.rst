   See AMD Vitis™ Development Environment on `xilinx.com <https://www.xilinx.com/products/design-tools/vitis.html>`_



The Hardware Acceleration Feature Tutorials illustrate specific features or flows of Vitis. Some features might not be required by all designs but are still useful for some use cases.

The :doc:`landing page <../../Hardware_Acceleration>` of Hardware Acceleration contains important information including tool version, environment settings, and a table describing the platform, kernels, and supported features or flows of each tutorial. It is strongly recommended that you review the details before starting to use the acceleration tutorials.

   * - Tutorial
     - Description
	 
   * - :doc:`Getting Started with RTL Kernels <./01-rtl_kernel_workflow/README>`
     - This tutorial demonstrates how to use the Vitis core development kit to program an RTL kernel into an FPGA and build a Hardware Emulation using a common development flow.

   * - :doc:`Mixing C and RTL <./02-mixing-c-rtl-kernels/README>`
     - This tutorial demonstrates how to work with an application containing RTL and C kernels, along with various design analysis features.

   * - :doc:`Dataflow Debug and Optimization <./03-dataflow_debug_and_optimization/README>`
     - This tutorial demonstrates how to debug and optimize the dataflow optimization in Vitis HLS.

   * - :doc:`Using Multiple DDR Banks <./04-mult-ddr-banks/README>`
     - This tutorial demonstrates how using multiple DDRs can improve data transfer between kernels and global memory.

   * - :doc:`Using Multiple Compute Units <./05-using-multiple-cu/README>`
     - This tutorial demonstrates the flexible kernel linking process to increase the number of kernel instances on an FPGA, which improves the parallelism in a combined host-kernel system.

   * - :doc:`Controlling Vivado Implementation <./06-controlling-vivado-implementation/README>`
     - This tutorial demonstrates how you can control the AMD Vivado™ tools flow when implementing your project.

   * - :doc:`Optimizing for HBM <./07-using-hbm/README>`
     - This tutorial demonstrates how you can take best advantage of HBM on platforms that support it.

   * - :doc:`Host Memory Access <./08-using-hostmem/README>`
     - This tutorial demonstrates how kernels can directly access buffers host memory directly. This capability requires a compatible platform.

   * - :doc:`Using GT Kernels and Ethernet IPs on Alveo <./09-using-ethernet-on-alveo/README>`
     - This tutorial demonstrates how to use networking GT kernels with generated Ethernet IPs and implement them on AMD Alveo™ card with Vitis flow.

   * - :doc:`Enabling FPGA to FPGA P2P Transfer using Native XRT C++ API <./10-p2p-card-to-card/README>`
     - This tutorial demonstrates how to enable p2p transfer from one FPGA device to another using XRT API host code.
