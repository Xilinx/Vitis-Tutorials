# Introduction

This tutorial introduces the user to the Vitis AI TensorFlow design process and will illustrate how to go from a python description of the network model to running a compiled model on the Xilinx&reg; DPU accelerator.

The application code in this example design is written in Python and uses the VART runtime and unified APIs.

We will run the following steps:

1. Training and evaluation of a customised version of the DenseNet network using TensorFlow Keras.
2. Conversion of the HDF5 format Keras checkpoint into a TensorFlow compatible checkpoint.
3. Removal of the training nodes and conversion of the graph variables to constants (..often referred to as 'freezing the graph').
4. Evaluation of the frozen model using the CIFAR-10 test dataset.
5. Quantization of the floating-point frozen model.
6. Evaluation of the quantized model using the CIFAR-10 test dataset.
7. Compilation of the quantized model to create the .xmodel file ready for execution on the DPU accelerator IP.
8. Download and execution of the application on an evaluation board.


# The CIFAR-10 Dataset

CIFAR-10 is a publicly available dataset that contains a total of 60k RGB images each of which are 32pixels x 32pixels x8bits per color channel. The small image size of 32 x 32 means that it is not very useful for real-world applications, but the CIFAR-10 dataset makes a good starting point for studying machine learning. The complete dataset of 60k images is normally divided into 50k images for training and 10k images for testing/validation.

There are a total of 10 mutually exclusive classes (or labels):


| Class index | Class name |
| :---: | --- |
| 0 | airplane |
| 1 | automobile |
| 2 | bird |
| 3 | cat |
| 4 | deer |
| 5 | dog |
| 6 | frog |
| 7 | horse |
| 8 | ship |
| 9 | truck |


# The DenseNetX CNN

The DenseNet architecture was first proposed by Huang et al in their paper ['Densely Connected Convolutional Networks'](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.06993.pdf) The code provided in the ``DenseNetX.py`` python script is based on version 5 of the paper and includes the Bottleneck layers and Compression factor, so strictly speaking is a DenseNet-BC implementation. It also includes some minor modifications to make it compatible with the Vitis AI quantizer and compiler. In particular, the order of the BatchNorm, RelU activation and Convolution layers has been altered from BN->ReLU->Conv to Conv->BN->ReLU.

The authors of the original paper used a Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimizer whereas the training script in this example (``train.py``) uses RMSProp - the code required for SGD optimization is also provided, just uncomment it and then comment out the RMSProp optimizer, like this:

```python
    '''
    Optimizer
    RMSprop used in this example.
    SGD  with Nesterov momentum was used in original paper
    '''
    opt = SGD(lr=learnrate, momentum=0.9, nesterov=True)
    #opt = RMSprop(lr=learnrate)
```


The code in ``DenseNetX.py`` is set for the CIFAR10 dataset, so the first convolutional layer uses a 3x3 kernel with a stride length of 1 and the first max pooling layer is ommitted:


```python
    # Use this for CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100
    # first convolutional layer + BN + ReLU (Imagenet style)
    net = Conv2D((2*k),3,strides=1,use_bias=False,kernel_initializer='he_uniform',kernel_regularizer=l2(weight_decay),padding='same')(input_layer)
    net = BatchNormalization()(net)
    net = Activation('relu')(net)
```


In the original DenseNet paper, the first convolutional layer was set for a 7x7 kernel, stride lengths of 2 and a max pooling layer was included for the ImageNet dataset:


```python
    # Use this for IMAGENET
    # first convolutional layer + BN + ReLU
    net = Conv2D((2*k), 7, strides=2, use_bias=False)(input_layer)
    net = BatchNormalization()(net)
    net = Activation('relu')(net)

    # max pooling layer
    net = MaxPooling2D(3, 2)(net)
```

**Note**: You must adjust this code according to the size of your input data.

A picture of the complete network can be found at ./img/model.png.


## DenseNet-121, 169, 201 and 264 Naming

The authors of the original paper labelled the architectures they created for ImageNet as DenseNet-121, 169, 201 and 264.  (Reference 1, Table 1). It can be useful to understand how they arrived at that nomenclature.

They used the parameter 'L' to indicate the depth of their networks but counted only the convolutional and fully-connected layers, they did not include the pooling, batch norm or activation layers.

For example, DenseNet-121 is made up of:

+ the first convolutional layer = 1
+ 1 dense block of 6 1x1 and 3x3 convolutional layers = 6 x 2 = 12.
+ 1 transition layer with 1 convolutional layer = 1.
+ 1 dense block of 12 1x1 and 3x3 convolutional layers = 12 x 2 = 24.
+ 1 transition layer with 1 convolutional layer = 1.
+ 1 dense block of 24 1x1 and 3x3 convolutional layers = 24 x 2 = 48.
+ 1 transition layer with 1 convolutional layer = 1.
+ 1 dense block of 16 1x1 and 3x3 convolutional layers = 16 x 2 = 32.
+ 1 classification layer which contains 1 fully-connected layer = 1


The sum of 1 + 12 + 1 + 24 + 1 + 48 + 1 + 32 + 1 = 121


The DenseNetX model provided in this tutorial has 3 dense blocks each of which have 16 sets of 1x1 and 3x3 convolutions. The 3 dense blocks are created by the `convlayers` argument which must be provided as a Python list:

```python
 model = densenetx(input_shape=(input_height,input_width,input_chan),classes=10,theta=0.5,drop_rate=0.3,k=12,convlayers=[16,16,16])
```


# Implementing the design

This section will lead you through the steps necessary to run the design in hardware.


## Before you begin

The host machine has several requirements that need to be met before we begin. You will need:

  + An x86 host machine with a supported OS and the GPU version of the Vitis-AI docker installed - see [System Requirements](https://github.com/Xilinx/Vitis-AI/blob/master/docs/system_requirements.md).

  + The host machine will require Docker to be installed and the Vitis-AI GPU docker image to be built - see [Getting Started](https://github.com/Xilinx/Vitis-AI#getting-started).

  + A GPU card suitable for ML training - a GPU with at least 8GB of memory is recommended.

  + If you plan to use the ZCU102 evaluation board, it should be prepared with the board image as per the [Setup the Target](https://github.com/Xilinx/Vitis-AI/tree/master/setup/mpsoc/VART#step2-setup-the-target) instructions. Hints on how to connect the various cables to the ZCU102 are also available [here](https://www.xilinx.com/html_docs/vitis_ai/1_3/installation.html#yjf1570690235238).

  + For the Alveo U50, follow the [Setup Alveo Accelerator Card with HBM for DPUCAHX8H/L](https://github.com/Xilinx/Vitis-AI/tree/master/setup/alveo/u50_u50lv_u280#setup-alveo-accelerator-card-with-hbm-for-dpucahx8hl) instructions. You will need to install the specified version of XRT on your host system (i.e. *not* in the Vitis-AI docker container), install the Alveo U50 card target platform also on your host system and then flash the Alveo U50 card. Note that a cold reboot will be necessary afer flashing the Alveo U50.

 
For more details, refer to the latest version of the *Vitis AI User Guide* ([UG1414](https://www.xilinx.com/html_docs/vitis_ai/1_3/zmw1606771874842.html)).

This tutorial assumes the user is familiar with Python3, TensorFlow and has some knowledge of machine learning principles.


## Downloading the Design and Setting up the Workspace

1. Copy the repository by doing either of the following:

    + Download the repository as a ZIP file to the host machine, and then unzip the archive.
    + From a terminal, use the `git clone` command.


2. Open a linux terminal on the host machine, cd into the repository folder then into the 'files' folder. If you have a GPU in the host system, it is recommended that you use the GPU version of the docker container. If you intend running the model training, you will definitely need the GPU docker container. If you are going to skip the training phase, then the CPU docker container will be sufficient.
To start the Vitis-AI Docker container, enter on of the following commands (note: start *either* the GPU or the CPU docker container, but not both):

     ```shell
     # navigate to densenet tutorial folder
     cd <path_to_densenet_design>/files

     # to start GPU docker container
     source start_gpu_docker.sh

     # to start CPU docker container
     source start_cpu_docker.sh
    ```


The docker container will start and you should see something like this in the terminal:


```shell
     ==========================================
     
     __      ___ _   _                   _____

```


>:bulb: If you get a "Permission Denied" error when running the start_gpu_docker.sh or start_cpu_docker.sh scripts, it is almost certainly because the docker_run.sh script is not set to be executable. You can fix this by running the following command:
>
>```shell
> chmod +x ./docker_run.sh
>```

## Step 0 - Set up the environment

Now run the environment setup script:  `source ./0_setenv.sh`

This will set up all the environment variables (..mainly pointers to folders and files..) most of which users can edit as required. It will also create the folders for the logs and the trained keras checkpoint.

The 0_setenv.sh script also activates the 'vitis-ai-tensorflow' TensorFlow conda environment, so you should now see that the terminal prompt looks like this:


```shell
  (vitis-ai-tensorflow) user@my_pc:/workspace$
```


## Step 1 - Training

:pushpin: Training takes a considerable time, between 8-12 hours depending on the GPU. Users can either:

+ Reduce the number of epochs by editing the ``export EPOCHS=200`` line in the 0_setenv.sh shell script. Obviously, less epochs of training will have a negative impact on the final accuracy. You need sto run the 0_setenv.sh shell script again if you modify it.
+ The batchsize is set by the line `export BATCHSIZE=150`. If you run into out-of-memory issues, then try reducing the batchsize.
+ Skip the training phase altogether and use the pretrained Keras checkpoint available in ./files/pretrained/keras_model.zip. The k_model.h5 file inside this zip archive should be copied to the ./files/build/keras_model folder and the remaining parts of Step 1 should be skipped, and users should go direct to Step 2 (see run_all.sh) 


To run step 1: ``source 1_train.sh``

The training process is defined by the train.py Python script. First, the CIFAR10 dataset is downloaded and pre-processed by the datadownload.py script which is called by train.py. All images undergo simple pre-processing before being used for training, evaluation and quantization calibration. The images are normalized to bring all pixel values into the range 0 to 1.0 by dividing them by 255.

The images will also undergo augmentation in the form of random rotation, horizontal flipping (i.e. around the *vertical* axis), shifting up and down, shearing and zooming:


```python
data_augment = ImageDataGenerator(rotation_range=10,
                                  horizontal_flip=True,
                                  height_shift_range=0.1,
                                  width_shift_range=0.1,
                                  shear_range=0.1,
                                  zoom_range=0.1)

train_generator = data_augment.flow(x=x_train,
                                    y=y_train,
                                    batch_size=batchsize,
                                    shuffle=True)
```

At the end of training, the accuracy of the trained model will be calculated using the .evaluate method:


```python
scores = model.evaluate(x=x_test, y=y_test, batch_size=50, verbose=0)
print ('Evaluation Loss    : ', scores[0])
print ('Evaluation Accuracy: ', scores[1])
```


After training has finished, the trained Keras checkpoint will be found in the ./files/build/keras_model folder as an HDF5 file called k_model.h5.

*Note: Any error messages relating to CUPTI can be ignored.*


## Step 2 - Convert the Keras HDF5 Checkpoint to a TensorFlow Frozen Graph

To run step 2: ``source 2_keras2tf.sh``

The Vitis AI tools cannot operate directly on Keras checkpoints and require a TensorFlow compatible frozen graph as the input format. The 2_keras2tf.sh shell script will create the frozen graph in two steps:

1. The HDF5 file is converted to a TensorFlow checkpoint.
2. The TensorFlow checkpoint is converted to a 'frozen graph' in binary protobuf format.

The output .pb file is generally known as a 'frozen graph' since all variables are converted into constants and graph nodes associated with training such as the optimizer and loss functions are stripped out.

After this step is completed, there should be a protobuf file called 'frozen_graph.pb' in the ./files/build/freeze folder.


## Step 3 - Evaluate the Frozen Graph

To run step 2: ``source 3_eval_frozen.sh``

This is an optional step as the frozen graph is still in floating-point format and should give almost identical accuracy results as the evaluation done during the training phase (step 1). All 10k images of CIFAR10 test images are passed through the frozen model and the accuracy is calculated.


## Step 4 - Quantize the Frozen Graph

To run step 4: ``source 4_quant.sh``

The DPU accelerator IP executes all calculations in 8bit integer format, so we must quantize our floating-point frozen graph. This is done by the Vitis AI tools, in particular by the 'vai_q_tensorflow quantize' command. This command can be seen in the 4_quant.sh script and has several arguments that we must provide values for:


| Argument              | Description                                                    |
|---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
|`--input_frozen_graph` | path and name of the input  .pb frozen graph                   |
|`--input_fn`           | Name of input function used in calibration pre-processing      |
|`--output_dir`         | Name of the output folder where the quantized models are saved |
|`--input_nodes`        | Name(s) of the input nodes                                     |
|`--output_nodes`       | Name(s) of the output nodes                                    |
|`--input_shapes`       | Shape(s) of the input nodes                                    |
|`--calib_iter`         | Number of calibration iterations                               |


*Note: Any error messages relating to ./bin/ptxas can be ignored.*

Most of the arguments are self-explanatory but special mention needs to be made of --input_fn and --calib_iter.

We require a sample set of data to calibrate the quantization process. This data will be passed through the model in one forward pass and so must be processed in exactly the same way as the data is pre-processed in training...the function pointed to be the --input_fn argument will need to contain all of the pre-processing steps.

The images for the calibration are created by the tf_gen_images.py python script and then stored in the ./files/build/quantize/images folder along with a text file which lists those images. This folder will be deleted after quantization is finished to reduce occupied disk space.

The image_input_fn.py Python script contains a single function called calib_input (..hence we set --input_fn to image_input_fn.calib_input in the 4_quant.sh shell script..) which opens the images with OpenCV, flips them to RGB from BGR as the model was trained on RGB images and then normalizes them to have all pixels in the range 0 to 1.0, exactly as was done in training and evaluation.

The number of images generated for use in calibration is set by the CALIB_IMAGES environment variable in the 0_setenv.sh script. Care should be taken that the number of calibration iterations (--calib_iter) multiplied by the calibration batch size (set in the image_input_fn.py script) does not exceed the total number of available images (CALIB_IMAGES).

Once quantization has completed, we will have the quantized deployment model (deploy_model.pb) and the evaluation model (quantize_eval_model.pb) in the ./files/build/quantize folder.


## Step 5 - Evaluate the Quantized Model

To run step 5: ``source 5_eval_quant.sh``

This is an optional, but *highly* recommended step. The conversion from a floating-point model where the values can have a very wide dynamic range to an 8bit model where values can only have one of 256 values almost inevitably leads to a small loss of accuracy. We use the quantized evaluation model to see exactly how much impact the quantization has had.

The exact same Python script, eval_graph.py, that was used to evaluate the frozen graph is used to evaluate the quantized model.


## Step 6 - Compile the Quantized Model

To run step 6: ``source 6_compile.sh zcu102`` or ``source 6_compile.sh u50``

The DPU IP is a soft-core IP whose only function is to accelerate the execution of convolutional neural networks. It is a co-processor which has its own instruction set - those instructions are passed to the DPU in a proprietary format know as xmodel.

The Vitis AI compiler will convert, and optimize where possible, the quantized model to a set of micro-instructions and then output them in an .xmodel file.

The generated instructions are specific to the particular configuration of the DPU. The DPU's parameters are contained in a .dcf file which needs to be created for each target board - see the Vitis AI User Guide for details. In the specific case of Xilinx evaluation boards, Alveo accelerator cards and the prepared SDcard image file that we used back in the 'Preparing the host machine and target board' section, the .dcf file is included in the docker container and its location is passed to the vai_c_tensorflow command via the --arch argument.

In this tutorial, we will not include a Softmax function in our application code but instead use a Numpy argmax function to extract the predicted class from the vector of probabilities returned by the DPU.

Once compile is complete, the .xmodel file will be stored in the files/build/compile_zcu102 or files/build/compile_u50 folder.


## Step 7 - Run the Application on the target board

To run step 7: ``source ./7_make_target.sh zcu102`` or ``source ./7_make_target.sh u50``


This final step will copy all the required files for running on the board into the files/build/target_zcu102 or files/build/target_u50 folder. The scripts also create 10000 images from the CIFAR10 test set - the application code will preprocess and classify these images.

### ZCU102

For the ZCU102, it will be necessary to copy the entire target_zcu102 folder to the evaluation board SDcard. Copy it to the /home/root folder of the flashed SD card, this can be done in one of several ways:

1. Direct copy to SD Card:

  + If the host machine has an SD card slot, insert the flashed SD card and when it is recognised you will see two volumes, BOOT and ROOTFS. Navigate into the ROOTFS and then into the /home folder.  Make the ./root folder writeable by issuing the command ``sudo chmod -R 777 root`` and then copy the entire target_zcu102 (or target_vck190) folder from the host machine into the /home/root folder of the SD card.

  + Unmount both the BOOT and ROOTFS volumes from the host machine and then eject the SD Card from the host machine.

2. With scp command:

  + If the target evaluation board is connected to the same network as the host machine, the target_zcu102 folder can be copied using scp.

  + The command will be something like ``scp -r ./build/target_zcu102 root@192.168.1.227:~/.``  assuming that the target board IP address is 192.168.1.227 - adjust this as appropriate for your system.

  + If the password is asked for, insert 'root'.


With the target_zcu102 folder copied to the SD Card and the evaluation board booted, you can issue the command for launching the application - note that this done on the target evaluation board, not the host machine, so it requires a connection to the board such as a serial connection to the UART or an SSH connection via Ethernet.

The application can be started by navigating into the target_zcu102 folder and then issuing the command ``python3 app_mt.py``. The application will start and after a few seconds will show the throughput in frames/sec, like this:

```shell
root@xilinx-zcu102-2020_2:~# cd target_zcu102/
root@xilinx-zcu102-2020_2:~/target_zcu102# python3 app_mt.py 
Command line options:
 --image_dir :  images
 --threads   :  1
 --model     :  model_dir/densenetx.xmodel
Pre-processing 10000 images...
Starting 1 threads...
Throughput=417.97 fps, total frames = 10000, time=23.9252 seconds
output buffer length: 10000
Correct:9126, Wrong:874, Accuracy:0.9126
```

For better throughput, the number of threads can be increased like this:

```shell
root@xilinx-zcu102-2020_2:~/target_zcu102# python3 app_mt.py -t 5
Command line options:
 --image_dir :  images
 --threads   :  5
 --model     :  model_dir/densenetx.xmodel
Pre-processing 10000 images...
Starting 5 threads...
Throughput=855.58 fps, total frames = 10000, time=11.6879 seconds
output buffer length: 10000
Correct:9126, Wrong:874, Accuracy:0.9126
```

### U50

Note that these steps need to be run from inside of the Vitis-AI Docker container.

Run the `U50_overlay.sh` script (internet connection required) to download and install the correct overlay. Note that the U50 will need to have been flashed with the correct deployment shell - this should have been done in the [Before you begin](#before-you-begin) section above. The complete steps to run on the Alveo U50 are as follows:


```shell
Vitis-AI /workspace > source U50_overlay.sh
Vitis-AI /workspace > cd build/target_u50
Vitis-AI /workspace > /usr/bin/python3 app_mt.py
```
The output on the host machine will be like this:

```shell
Command line options:
 --image_dir :  images
 --threads   :  1
 --model     :  model_dir/densenetx.xmodel
Pre-processing 10000 images...
Starting 1 threads...
Throughput=560.81 fps, total frames = 10000, time=17.8312 seconds
output buffer length: 10000
Correct:9126, Wrong:874, Accuracy:0.9126
```

As for the ZCU102, performance can be increased by using more than one thread:

```shell
Vitis-AI /workspace/build/target_u50 > /usr/bin/python3 app_mt.py  -t 6
Command line options:
 --image_dir :  images
 --threads   :  6
 --model     :  model_dir/densenetx.xmodel
Pre-processing 10000 images...
Starting 6 threads...
Throughput=1313.83 fps, total frames = 10000, time=7.6113 seconds
output buffer length: 10000
Correct:9126, Wrong:874, Accuracy:0.9126
```
