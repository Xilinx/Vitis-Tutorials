## Vitis Embedded Software Tutorials

The tutorials under the Vitis™ Embedded Software category help you learn the Vitis Embedded Design Flows.

- The <a href="./Getting_Started/">**Getting Started**</a> tutorial should act as the start point, or a refresher to the Vitis Unified Embedded flows. The concepts will be kept simple to allow the user to navigate through the IDE with minimal steps to get started. We will create the platform, hello world application, setup the target connections and debug our hello world application over JTAG. We will then learn how to program the flash.

- The <a href="./Feature_Tutorials/">**Feature Tutorials**</a> illustrate specific features of Vitis Embedded Software development flow, some features may not be required by all designs but are still useful for some use cases.

- The <a href="./Design_Tutorials/">**Design Tutorials**</a> illustrate higher-level concepts or design flows, walk through specific examples or reference designs, and more complex and complete designs or applications.
