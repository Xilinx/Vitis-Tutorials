# Step 2: Create the Software Components and the Vitis DFX Platform

The software components of an AMD Vitis™ extensible platform are identical no matter whether the platform supports DFX or not. Refer to VCK190 Custom Platform Tutorial for details about preparing software components from common image or build them from scratch.

The unique requirements from DFX platforms are from the device tree.

## Generating Device Tree

Use the static XSA to generate the base device tree with device tree generator (DTG). The generated device tree (.dts and .dtsi) only includes IP information in the static region. If any IP in the dynamic region needs driver support, you should add them to the device tree manually. AI Engine is an example that needs driver support. Add its information to ``system-user.dtsi``.

>**Note:** Only one DFX region is supported at the moment; therefore, the ZOCL driver and device tree only supports one dfx_decoupler IP address.

>**Note:** If you have multiple RM and they have different IPs, you can enable these IP with device tree overlay. Device tree overlay is out of the scope of this tutorial.

### Add AI Engine Information to the ``system-user.dtsi`` File

```
&amba_pl {
	ai_engine@20000000000 {
		#address-cells = <0x02>;
		#size-cells = <0x02>;
		clock-names = "aclk0";
		clocks = <0x13>;
		compatible = "xlnx,ai-engine-2.0\0xlnx,ai-engine-v2.0";
		power-domains = <0x07 0x18224072>;
		ranges;
		reg = <0x200 0x00 0x01 0x00>;
		xlnx,aie-gen = [01];
		xlnx,core-rows = [01 08];
		xlnx,mem-rows = [00 00];
		xlnx,shim-rows = [00 01];

		aie_aperture@20000000000 {
			#address-cells = <0x02>;
			#size-cells = <0x02>;
			interrupt-names = "interrupt1\0interrupt2\0interrupt3";
			interrupt-parent = <0x05>;
			interrupts = <0x00 0x94 0x04 0x00 0x95 0x04 0x00 0x96 0x04>;
			power-domains = <0x07 0x18224072>;
			reg = <0x200 0x00 0x01 0x00>;
			xlnx,columns = <0x00 0x32>;
			xlnx,node-id = <0x18800000>;
		};
	};
	aie_core_ref_clk_0 {
		#clock-cells = <0x00>;
		clock-frequency = <0x3B9ACA00>;
		compatible = "fixed-clock";
		phandle = <0x13>;
	};
};
```

A prepared [system-user.dtsi](ref_file/step2_sw/system-user.dtsi) file is ready for use.

If you updated the AI Engine clock frequency, please update the `clock-frequency` of `aie_core_ref_clk_0`.
  
### Generate the Base Device Tree from the Static XSA

```bash
createdts -hw <static XSA> \
    -zocl\
    -out . \
    -platform-name vck190_custom_dt \
    -git-branch xlnx_rel_v2023.2 \
    -dtsi system-user.dtsi \
    -board versal-vck190-reva-x-ebm-01-reva \
    -compile
```

The generated device tree files are located in ``build/vck190_custom_dt/psv_cortexa72_0/device_tree_domain/bsp`` path. You can find the ``system.dtb`` file in ``step2_sw/build/vck190_custom_dt/psv_cortexa72_0/device_tree_domain/bsp/`` directory.

> **NOTE**: Device tree knowledge is a common know-how. Please refer to [AMD Device tree WIKI page](https://xilinx-wiki.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/A/pages/862421121/Device+Trees) or [Device Tree WIKI page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devicetree#Linux) for more information if you are not familiar with it.

### Creating the Vitis Platform

The Vitis platform creation workflow for DFX platforms is almost identical to the flat platform with the following exceptions

- The platform creation can only be created with XSCT. Vitis IDE does not support to create DFX platforms.

- When creating the DFX platform, both static XSA and RP XSA are required. Static XSA will be used to create ``boot.bin``. RP XSA is used to link acceleration kernels.

### Prepare for Platform Packaging

You should prepare the following components before creating the platform.

| Component                                     | Conventional Path or Filename                         | Description                                                   |
| --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Boot components                   | boot/bl31.elf</br>boot/u-boot.elf</br>boot/system.dtb | All components referred in linux.bif should be in this folder |
| Boot components in FAT32 partition of SD Card | sd_dir/boot.scr                                        | U-boot configuration file to store in FAT32 partition of SD card                                    |
| Linux Software Components         | sw_comp/Image</br>sw_comp/rootfs.ext4</br>sw_comp/sysroots | Linux components for application creation and Linux booting. They can be packaged into platform or stay standalone and be linked during application creation process. |

This tutorial uses the Linux software components provided by the Common Images. You can store all the necessary files for Vitis platform creation flow in the ``step2_sw/build/pfm`` directory.

1. Download and extract the Common Images for AMD Versal™ devices.

   - Visit the [Vitis Embedded Platforms](https://www.xilinx.com/support/download/index.html/content/xilinx/en/downloadNav/embedded-platforms.html) download page.
   - Download the Versal common image to `step2_sw/build/common` from the 2023.2 page.
   - Extract the downloaded package using the `cd step2_sw/build/common; tar -xzf xilinx-versal-common-v2023.2.tar.gz` command.

2. Prepare the boot components.

   From the table above, you know that the boot components include the following items:

   - ``bl31.elf``
   - ``u-boot.elf``
   - ``system.dtb``

   Follow these steps to copy them to boot directory.

   - Create directory for boot components `mkdir step2_sw/build/boot`.
   - Copy boot components from common image directory.

     ```bash
     cp step2_sw/build/common/bl31.elf step2_sw/build/boot
     cp step2_sw/build/common/u-boot.elf step2_sw/build/boot
     ```

   - Copy device tree.

     ```bash
     cp step2_sw/build/vck190_custom_dt/psv_cortexa72_0/device_tree_domain/bsp/system.dtb step2_sw/build/boot
     ```

3. Prepare the ``sd_dir`` directory. Contents in this directory will be packaged to FAT32 partition of SD card image by v++ package tool.

   1. Create the ``sd_dir`` directory: `mkdir step2_sw/build/sd_dir`
   2. Copy ``boot.scr`` from the common image directory ``step2_sw/build/common`` to the ``step2_sw/build/sd_dir`` directory. It is a script for U-Boot initialization. U-boot will read it from FAT32 partition during boot process.

4. Prepare Linux software components for application creation. Platform packaging can add them or exclude them. Due to the software component size, they are usually kept outside of platforms so that these components can be reused among multiple platforms with the same architecture. On the other side, keeping Linux software components in the platform can prevent mix and match different combinations when delivering the platform from one team to another. Here we keep the Linux software components standalone.

   ```bash
   # Create sw_comp directory
   mkdir step2_sw/build/sw_comp
   cd sw_comp
   # Copy Linux kernel image
   cp <COMMON_IMAGE_PATH>/Image .
   # Copy EXT4 Root Filesystem
   cp <COMMON_IMAGE_PATH>/rootfs.ext4 .
   # Install sysroot to this directory
   <COMMON_IMAGE_PATH>/sdk.sh -d ./ -y
   ```

Finally, your prepared directory structure looks like this.

```
tree -L 3 --charset ascii
.
|-- boot
|   |-- bl31.elf
|   |-- system.dtb
|   `-- u-boot.elf
|-- sd_dir
|   `-- boot.scr
|-- sw_comp
|   |-- environment-setup-cortexa72-cortexa53-xilinx-linux
|   |-- Image
|   |-- rootfs.ext4
|   |-- site-config-cortexa72-cortexa53-xilinx-linux
|   |-- sysroots
|   |   |-- cortexa72-cortexa53-xilinx-linux
|   |   `-- x86_64-petalinux-linux
|   `-- version-cortexa72-cortexa53-xilinx-linux
```

>**Note:** If you run the fast track script, the boot directory only has ``linux.bif`` file because the platform creation script `xsct_create_pfm.tcl` uses the `<petalinux_project>/images/linux` directory as boot directory for components of the BIF file. To make the GUI flow easier, copy these components to the boot directory for preparation.

### Generating Static Boot Image

A DFX platform can boot the static region during power on. The static boot image can include static region PDI for hardware configuration, Arm® Trusted Firmware `bl31.elf`, `u-boot.elf`, and device tree for U-Boot.

When creating a DFX platform, static `boot.bin` is required. You generate this boot image before creating the platform.

Static PDI is included in the static region XSA. You can use the XSCT command `openhw $(XSA_NAME)_static.xsa` to extract the XSA and find the PDI.

Run bootgen command to create the boot.bin.

```bash
bootgen -arch versal -image bootgen.bif -o boot.bin;
```

The `bootgen.`bif` should contain the following information.

```bash
the_ROM_image:
{
image {
	{ type=bootimage, file=<static>.pdi }
}
image {
	id = 0x1c000000, name=apu_subsystem 
	{ type=raw, load=0x00001000, file=build/boot/system.dtb }
	{ core=a72-0, exception_level=el-3, trustzone, file=build/boot/bl31.elf }
	{ core=a72-0, exception_level=el-2, file=build/boot/u-boot.elf }
}
}
```

### Platform Packaging

Use XSCT command line tool to create the Vitis DFX platform.

>**Note:** Vitis IDE support for creating Vitis DFX platforms will be added in the future.

Create a tcl file with XSCT commands.

```Tcl
# Create a platform project
platform create -name vck190_dfx_custom \
    -desc "A custom VCK190 DFX platform" \
    -hw <Static>.xsa \
    -rp {id 0 hw <RP>.xsa hw_emu <HW_EMU>.xsa} \
    -out <Output_Directory> \
    -no-boot-bsp 

# AIE domain
domain create -name aiengine -os aie_runtime -proc ai_engine
domain config -qemu-data ./boot

# Add Linux domain
domain create -name xrt -proc psv_cortexa72 -os linux -sd-dir {./sd_dir} 
domain config -hw-boot-bin <PATH to Boot.bin>
domain config -boot {./boot}
domain config -generate-bif
domain config -qemu-data ./boot

platform write
platform generate
```

>**Note:** Replace the file name and directory name in the script with your project file location. If you do not need to support hardware emulation, you can omit the option `-hw_emu` and its value for the command `platform create`.

The `platform create` command needs the following input values:

- `-name`: Platform name
- `-hw`: Static Hardware XSA file location
- `-rp`: The reconfigurable partition info with ID, XSA and hardware emulation XSA info. ID is reserved for multi-partition DFX. For now only one partition is supported. Please use `id 0`.
- `-out`: Platform output path. In this example, we set output directory to ``step2_sw/build/pfm``.
- `-sd-dir`: The directory that contains the files to be included in the FAT32 partition of the SD card image.

The `domain` command will set up one AI Engine domain and one Linux domain. The Linux domain has SD boot mode. The DFX platform Linux domain requires you to provide the `boot.bin` to boot the static region. It will use files in the `./sd_dir` directory to form the FAT32 partition of the SD card image. You have stored the required files in these directories in [Prepare for Platform Packaging](#prepare-for-platform-packaging) step.

You can pass the values to the script directly by replacing the variable with the actual value, or define them in the header of the Tcl script, or pass the value to XSCT when calling this script.

Here is an example of calling XSCT if you hard code all contents in `xsct_create_pfm.tcl`.

```bash
xsct xsct_create_pfm.tcl
```

To support better generalization, the example [Makefile](./ref_files/step2_sw/Makefile) and [xsct_create_pfm.tcl](./ref_files/step2_sw/xsct_create_pfm.tcl) in the `ref_files` directory uses variables to represent the file names and directory location. Refer to them if you would like to get more programmability in your scripts.

### Next Step

Next, move to [step 3 to try to build some applications on this platform and test them.](./step3.md)

### Fast Track

Scripts are provided to generate the device tree and generating the platform. To use these scripts, run the following steps.

1. Run build:

   ```bash
   # cd to the step directory, e.g.
   cd step2_sw
   make
   ```

   The created platform is located in the `step2_sw/build/pfm/vck190_custom_dfx/export` directory.

2. To clean the generated files, run:

   ```bash
   make clean
   ```
