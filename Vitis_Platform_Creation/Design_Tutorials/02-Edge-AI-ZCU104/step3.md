You can verify clock information and memory information are set as expected.

## Test 2: Run Vector Addition Application

Vector addition is the simplest acceleration PL kernel. The Vitis Unified IDE can create this application automatically. Running this test can check the AXI control bus, memory interface, and interrupt setting in platform are working properly.

1. Creating Vector Addition Application

   - Go to `WorkSpace` directory created in step1
   - Run Vitis by typing `vitis -w .` in the console. `-w` is to specify the workspace. `.` means the current workspace directory. Close the welcome tab after Vitis launches.
   - Go to example view by clicking the example button and select and click **Simple Vector Addition**.
      ![example.PNG](./images/example.PNG)
   - Click **Create Application from Template**. The project creation wizard would pop up. 
      - Input the **System project name** as `vadd` and use the default location for **System project location**. Then click **Next**.
      - Select **zcu104_custom** platform, click **Next**.
         >Note: If the platform component is not in the current workspace user could click **+** button to add the platform component.
      - Set **Kernel Image** to ```xilinx-zynqmp-common-v2023.2/Image```.
      - Set **Root FS** to ```xilinx-zynqmp-common-v2023.2/rootfs.ext4```.
      - Set **Sysroot** to ```zcu104_software_platform/xilinx-zynqmp-common-v2023.1/sysroots/cortexa72-cortexa53-xilinx-linux```. Then click **Next**.
      - Review the summary of your `vadd` system project and click **Finish**.

   After seconds the vadd system project, vadd host component and vadd kernel component will be ready in the component view.

2. Building Vector Addition Application

   Vadd system project supports three targets: Software emulation, Hardware emulation and Hardware. User could select the target accordingly following steps below.

   - Go to flow navigator and select vadd system project.

      ![build_application.PNG](./images/build_application.PNG)

   - Click **Build All** under the target
   - In the Build Component setup dialog please enable all the components. Then click **OK**.

      ![build_application.PNG](./images/build_component.PNG)

   After compilation is finished. Users can locate the `sd_card.img` by expanding the Output directory. This provides a logical view of the output. The actual path of `sd_card.img` file is located in `WrokSpace/vadd/build/<TARGET>/package/package/` directory. For example, if user targets hardware emulation, the `sd_card.img` file is in located in `WrokSpace/vadd/build/hw_emu/package/package/`. Users can also view the complete path of the `sd_card.img` file by simply hovering the mouse pointer over the image file.

3. Running Hardware Emulation 

   After the compilation for hardware emulation is finished, please follow steps below to run hardware emulation.

   - Click **Start Emulator** under **HARDWARE EMULATION** target. The Start Emulator setup page would pop up. Then click **Start**.

      ![build_application.PNG](./images/start_emulator.PNG)

   - Click **Run** after the emulator boots up to terminal

      ![build_application.PNG](./images/vadd_emulation_result.PNG)

   - Click **Stop emulator** to stop emulation after emulation is finished.

      ![build_application.PNG](./images/stop_emulator.PNG)

4. Running Vector Addition Application on the Board

   After the compilation for hardware is finished, please follow steps below to run on board.
   1. Copy ``vadd/build/hw/package/package/sd_card.img`` to local if the Vitis IDE is running on a remote server.

   2. Write ``sd_card.img`` onto the SD Card with SD Card image writer applications like Etcher on Windows or dd on Linux.

   3. Boot ZCU104 board with the SD card in SD boot mode.

      <details>
      <summary><strong>Steps to run the application:</strong></summary>

      First, login with user `petalinux` and set up a new password (it is then also the sudo password):

      1. Log into the system

         ```bash
         petalinux login:petalinux
         You are required to change your password immediately (administrator enforced).
         New password:
         Retype new password:
         petalinux:~$ sudo su
         We trust you have received the usual lecture from the local System
         Administrator. It usually boils down to these three things:
               #1) Respect the privacy of others.
               #2) Think before you type.
               #3) With great power comes great responsibility.
         Password:
         petalinux:/home/petalinux#
         ```

      2. Go to auto mounted FAT32 partition

         ```bash
         petalinux:/home/petalinux# cd /run/media/mmcblk0p1/
         ```

      3. Run vadd application

         ```bash
         ./simple_vadd krnl_vadd.xclbin
         ```

      It should show program prints and XRT debug information.

      ```
      TEST PASSED
      ```

### Fast Track for Vector Addition

Scripts are provided to create the test applications on the custom platform we created. To use these scripts, please run the following steps.

1. Run build

   ```bash
   # cd to the step directory, e.g.
   cd step3_validate
   make all
   ```

   The default verification uses hardware emulation. To verify vadd application on hardware board, run the following command to generate the SD card image.

   ```bash
   cd step3_validate
   make sd_card
   ```

2. To clean the generated files, run the following commands:

   ```bash
   make clean
   ```

The command line flow has slight differences comparing to Vitis IDE flow.

The vector addition application is called `vadd` and `binary_container_1.xclbin` in the Vitis IDE flow. The generated files in command line flow are called `simple_vadd` and `krnl_vadd.xclbin`.






## Congratulations

You have completed creating a custom platform from scratch and verifying it with a simple vadd application and a relatively complex Vitis AI use cases.

Feel free to check more tutorials in this repository.

## Next Steps

If user need to do iteration for your project, you could go through the [Iteration Guidelines](./Iteration_guideline.md) to do iterations.
