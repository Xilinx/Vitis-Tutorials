## Step 3: Create the Vitis Platform

First we create a Vitis platform project with the XSA file generated by Vivado from Step 1.

1. Source Vitis and XRT settings

   ```
   source <Vitis_Install_Directory>/settings64.sh
   source /opt/xilinx/xrt/setup.sh
   ```

2. Go to the ***zcu104_custom_pkg*** folder you created:

   ```
   cd <full_pathname_to_zcu104_custom_pkg>
   ```

3. Launch Vitis by typing ```vitis``` in the console.

4. Select ***zcu104_custom_pkg*** folder as workspace directory.

5. In the Vitis IDE, select ***File > New > Platform Project*** to create a platform project.<br />

6. Enter the project name. For this example, type ```zcu104_custom```, click ***Next***.

7. In the Platform page,

   a) Click ***Browse*** button, select the XSA file generated by the Vivado. In this case, it is located in ```vivado/zcu104_custom_platform.xsa```.
   b) Set the operating system to ***linux***.

   c) Set the processor to ***psu_cortexa53***.

   d) Architecture: ***64-bit***

   e) ***Uncheck*** option ***Generate boot components***, because we'll use PetaLinux generated boot components.

   f) Click ***Finish***.

Next we setup software settings in Platform Settings view.

1. In the Platform Settings view, observe the following:<br />
   - The name of the Platform Settings view matches the platform project name of ***zcu104_custom***.<br />
   - A psu_cortexa53 device icon is shown, containing a Linux on psu_cortexa53 domain.<br />
2. Click the ***linux on psu_cortexa53*** domain, browse to the locations and select the directory or file needed to complete the dialog box for the following:

   - ***Bif file***: Browse to ***zcu104_custom_pkg/pfm/boot/linux.bif*** file and click OK.
   - ***Boot Components Direcotory***: Browse to ***zcu104_custom_pkg/pfm/boot*** and click OK.
   - ***Linux Image Directory***: Browse to ***zcu104_custom_pkg/pfm/image*** and click OK.

11. Click ***zcu104_custom*** project in the Vitis Explorer view, click the ***Build*** button to generate the platform.

***Note: The generated platform is placed in the export directory. BSP and source files are also provided for re-building the FSBL and PMU if desired and are associated with the platform. The platform is ready to be used for application development.***
