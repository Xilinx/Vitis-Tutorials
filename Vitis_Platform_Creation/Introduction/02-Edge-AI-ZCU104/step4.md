### Test 2: Run Vector Addition Application

Vector addition is the simplest acceleration PL kernel. Vitis can create this application automatically. Running this test can check the AXI control bus, memory interface and interrupt setting in platform are working properly.

1. Creating Vector Addition Application

   - Open Vitis workspace you were using before.
   - Select **File -> New -> Application Project**.
   - Click **next**
   - Select **zcu104_custom** as platform, click **next**.
   - Name the project **vadd**, click **next**.
   - Set Domain to **linux on psu_cortexa53**, set **Sys_root path** to ```<full_pathname_to_zcu104_custom_pkg>/pfm/sysroots/aarch64-xilinx-linux```(as you created by running **sdk.sh**). Set the **Root FS** to rootfs.ext4 and **Kernel Image** to Image. These files are located in `zcu104_custom_plnx/images` directory, which are generated in Step 2. click **next**.
   - Select **System Optimization Examples -> Vector Addition** and click **finish** to generate the application.
   - In the Explorer window double click the **vadd.prj** file to open it, change the **Active Build configuration** from **Emulation-SW** to **Hardware**.
   - Select **vadd_system** in Explorer window and Click **Build** icon in toolbar.

   **Note**: If you cannot see the **zcu104_custom** platform we created, we can add it to platform list of New Project Wizard by selecting the add button and point to **zcu104_custom_pkg/zcu104_custom** directory.

   **Note**: If you'd like to test this application in emulation mode, plese change  **Active Build configuration** from **Emulation-SW** to **Emulation-HW** on Step 8.

2. Running Vector Addition Application on the Board

   - Copy **zcu104_custom_pkg/vadd_system/Hardware/package/sd_card.img** to local if Vitis is running on a remote server.
   - Write **sd_card.img** into SD Card with SD Card image writer applications like Etcher on Windows or dd on Linux.
   - Boot ZCU104 board with the SD card in SD boot mode.
   - Go to auto mounted FAT32 partition

   ```bash
   cd /mnt/sd-mmcblk0p1
   ```

   - Run vadd application

   ```bash
   ./vadd binary_container_1.xclbin
   ```

   - It should show program prints and XRT debug info.

   ```
   TEST PASSED
   ```

3. Test Vector Addition Application in Emulation Mode (Optional)

   - Use **Vitis menu -> Xilinx -> Start/Stop Emulator** to launch QEMU. Project is vadd, configuration is Emulation-HW. Click Start. Wait for Linux to boot. Log in with root/root.
   - Right click **vadd** project (not the vadd_system system project), select **Run as -> Launch on Emulator**

   The result will show on Console tab.

   ```
   Loading: './binary_container_1.xclbin'
   TEST PASSED
   ```

### Fast Track for Vector Addtion

Scripts are provided to create the test applications on the custom platform we created. To use these scripts, please run the following steps.

1. Run build

   ```bash
   # cd to the step directory, e.g.
   cd step4_validate
   make all
   ```

   The default verification uses hardware emulation. If you'd like to verify vadd application on hardware board, please run the following command to generate the SD card image.

   ```bash
   cd step4_validate
   make vadd_hw
   ```

2. To clean the generated files, please run

   ```bash
   make clean
   ```

### Test 3: Run a Vitis-AI Demo

This test will run a Vitis-AI test application in DPU-TRD to verify DPU function on our custom platform. The most instructions below follows [Vitis-AI DPU-TRD document](https://github.com/Xilinx/Vitis-AI/tree/master/dsa/DPU-TRD/prj/Vitis#6-gui-flow).

#### Create the design

1. Add Vitis-AI repository into Vitis IDE
   
   - Launch Vitis IDE if you have not. We can reuse the workspace of vadd application.
   - Open menu Window -> Preferences
   - Go to Library Repository tab
   - Add Vitis-AI:
     - Click **Add** button
     - Input ID: vitis-ai
     - Name: Vitis AI
     - Location: assign a target download directory or keep empty. Vitis will use default path `~/.Xilinx` if this field is empty.
     - Git URL: `https://github.com/Xilinx/Vitis-AI.git`
     - Branch: The branch you'd like to verify with your platform. Use `master` for the latest version.

   ![](./images/vitis_repo_add_vai.png)


2. Download the Vitis-AI library
   
   - Open menu Xilinx -> Libraries
   - Find the Vitis-AI entry we just added. Click the Download button on it.
   - Wait until the download of Vitis-AI repository completes
   - Click OK to close this window.

   Vitis IDE will check the upstream status of each repository. If there are updates, it will allow users to download the updates if the source URL is a remote Git repository.

3. Download Vitis-AI specific sysroot
   
   Since Vitis-AI has a different release cycle with PetaLinux, Vitis-AI related PetaLinux recipes are released later than PetaLinux release. At the time that this tutorial releases, Vitis-AI related recipes are not released yet. We cannot build PetaLinux sysroot/sdk with Vitis-AI dependencies. We need to use pre-built Vitis-AI sdk.

   - Download the Vitis-AI cross compile environment setup script: `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xilinx/Vitis-AI/master/setup/mpsoc/VART/host_cross_compiler_setup.sh`
   - Update the script for installation area if necessary. The default install path is `install_path=~/petalinux_sdk_2021.1`
   - Run the script to setup cross compile environment: `./host_cross_compiler_setup.sh`

   Once Vitis-AI recipes are released, this tutorial will update the steps for building Vitis-AI dependencies to the sysroot using PetaLinux.

4. Create a Vitis-AI design on our zcu104_custom_platform

   - Go to menu **File** -> **New** -> **Application Project**
   - Click **Next** in Welcome page
   - Select platform **zcu104_custom_platform**. Click Next.
   - Name the project **dpu_trd**, click **next**.
   - Set Domain to **linux on psu_cortexa53**, set **Sys_root path** to sysroot installation path in previous step, e.g. `~/petalinux_sdk_2021.1/sysroots/cortexa72-cortexa53-xilinx-linux/`. 
   - Set the **Root FS** to rootfs.ext4 and **Kernel Image** to Image. These files are located in `zcu104_custom_plnx/images` directory, which are generated in Step 2. click **next**.
   - Select **dsa -> DPU Kernel (RTL Kernel)** and click **Finish** to generate the application.
   ![](images/vitis_add_dpu.png)

5. Update Build Target

   - Double click the system project file dpu_trd_system.sprj
   - Change Active Build Configuration to **Hardware**

6. Review and update DPU settings for ZCU104. The default created design has the DPU settings for ZCU102.

   - Open **dpu_conf.vh** from **dpu_trd_kernels/src/prj/Vitis** directory
   - Update line 37 from `URAM_DISABLE` to `URAM_ENABLE`
   - Press Ctrl+S to save the changes.

   **Note**: ZCU104 has ZU7EV device on board. It has less BRAM than ZU9EG on ZCU102 but it has URAM. Turning on URAM support can fulfill the on chip memory requirement by DPU.

7. Update system_hw_link for proper kernel instantiation

   Since ZCU104 has less LUT resources than ZCU102, it's hard to meet timing closure target if we include the softmax IP in PL like ZCU102. The implementation would take quite a long time. The Vitis-AI DPU-TRD design removes the softmax IP in hardware for ZCU104. When the host application detects no softmax IP in hardware, it will calculate softmax with software. The result will be identical but the calculation time will be different. Since our target is to verify the platform, we will remove the softmax kernel in our test application.

   - Double click dpu_trd_system_hw_link.prj.
   - In Hardware Functions window, remove sfm_xrt_top instance by right clicking it and select Remove.
   - After removing the sfx_xrt_top instance, the remaining instances in Hardware Functions window is DPUCZDX8G with Compute Units = 2.

8. Review system_hw_link v++ for proper kernel instantiation

   The DPU kernel requires two phase aligned clocks, 1x clock and 2x clock. The configuration is stored in the example design. It sets up clock and AXI interface connections between the DPU kernel to the platform. 

   Here's how to review the setup in the project.

   - Go to **Assistant View**
   - Double click **dpu_trd_system [System]**
   - Expand the left tree panel and find dpu_trd_system -> dpu_trd_system_hw_link -> Hardware -> dpu

   ![](./images/hw_link_dpu.png)

   - Click `...` button on the line of V++ Configuration Settings, it shows the configuration like this:

      ```
      [clock]
      freqHz=300000000:DPUCZDX8G_1.aclk
      freqHz=600000000:DPUCZDX8G_1.ap_clk_2
      freqHz=300000000:DPUCZDX8G_2.aclk
      freqHz=600000000:DPUCZDX8G_2.ap_clk_2

      [connectivity]
      sp=DPUCZDX8G_1.M_AXI_GP0:HPC0
      sp=DPUCZDX8G_1.M_AXI_HP0:HP0
      sp=DPUCZDX8G_1.M_AXI_HP2:HP1
      sp=DPUCZDX8G_2.M_AXI_GP0:HPC0
      sp=DPUCZDX8G_2.M_AXI_HP0:HP2
      sp=DPUCZDX8G_2.M_AXI_HP2:HP3
      ```

   > Note: the contents will be written to dpu-link.cfg during build time and pass to v++ Linker command line.

   > Note: To customize the v++ link configuration, you can add contents in V++ configuration settings, or create your own configuration file and add `--config <your_config_file.cfg>` to **V++ Command Line Options** field. If you need to use relative path for the configuration file, the base location is `dpu_trd_system_hw_link/Hardware` directory.


9.  Update package options to add dependency models into SD Card

   - Double click dpu_trd_system.sprj
   - Click ... button on Package options
   - Input `--package.sd_dir=../../dpu_trd/src/app`
   - Click OK

   All contents in the `--package.sd_dir` assigned directory will be added to the FAT32 partition of the sd_card.img. We package samples and models for verification. 
   
   The dpu_trd in the path name is the application project name in this example. If your project name is different, please update the project name accordingly.

10. Build the hardware design

   - Select the dpu_trd_system system project
   - Click the hammer button to build the system project
   - The generated SD card image is located at **dpu_trd_system/Hardware/package/sd_card.img**.

**Note**: Please refer to [Vitis-AI document](https://github.com/Xilinx/Vitis-AI/tree/master/dsa/DPU-TRD/prj/Vitis#6-gui-flow) for details about Vitis-AI project creation flow.

#### Run Application on Board

1. Write image to SD 

   - Copy the sd_card.img to a local workstation or laptop with SD card readers.
   - Write the image to SD card with [balena Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/) or similar tools

2. Boot the board

   - Insert the SD card to ZCU104
   - Set boot mode to SD boot
   - Connect USB UART cable
   - Power on the board. It should boot Linux properly in a minute.

3. Resize ext4 partition

   - Connect UART console if it's not connected.
   - On the ZCU104 board UART console, run `df .` to check current available disk size

   ```bash
   root@petalinux:~# df .
   Filesystem           1K-blocks      Used Available Use% Mounted on
   /dev/root               564048    398340    122364  77% /
   ```

   - Run `resize-part /dev/mmcblk0p2` to resize the ext4 partition. You need to input **Yes** and **100% **for confirming the resize to utilize full of the rest of SD card.

   ```bash
   root@petalinux:~# resize-part /dev/mmcblk0p2
   /dev/mmcblk0p2
   Warning: Partition /dev/mmcblk0p2 is being used. Are you sure you want to continue?
   parted: invalid token: 100%
   Yes/No? yes
   End?  [2147MB]? 100%
   Information: You may need to update /etc/fstab.

   resize2fs 1.45.3 (14-Jul-2019)
   Filesystem at /dev/mmcblk0p2 is mounted on /media/sd-mmcblk0p2; o[   72.751329] EXT4-fs (mmcblk0p2): resizing filesystem from 154804 to 1695488 blocks
   n-line resizing required
   old_desc_blocks = 1, new_desc_blocks = 1
   [   75.325525] EXT4-fs (mmcblk0p2): resized filesystem to 1695488
   The filesystem on /dev/mmcblk0p2 is now 1695488 (4k) blocks long.
   ```

   - Check available size again to verify that the ext4 partition size is enlarged.

   ```bash
   root@petalinux:~# df . -h
   Filesystem                Size      Used Available Use% Mounted on
   /dev/root                 6.1G    390.8M      5.4G   7% /
   ```

   **Note**: The available size would be different according to your SD card size.

   **Note**: **resize-part** is a script we added in [Step 2](./step2.md). It calls Linux utilities **parted** and **resize2fs** to extend the ext4 partition to take the rest of the SD card.

4. Copy dependency files to home folder

   ```bash
   # Libraries
   root@petalinux:~# cp -r /mnt/sd-mmcblk0p1/app/samples/ ~
   # Model
   root@petalinux:~# cp /mnt/sd-mmcblk0p1/app/model/resnet50.xmodel ~
   # Host app
   root@petalinux:~# cp /mnt/sd-mmcblk0p1/dpu_trd ~
   # Image to test
   root@petalinux:~# cp /mnt/sd-mmcblk0p1/app/img/bellpeppe-994958.JPEG ~
   ```

5. Run the application

   ```bash
   root@petalinux:~# env LD_LIBRARY_PATH=samples/lib XLNX_VART_FIRMWARE=/mnt/sd-mmcblk0p1/dpu.xclbin ./dpu_trd bellpeppe-994958.JPEG
   ```

   It would show bell pepper has the highest possibility.

#### Known Issues

1. The default setting of PMIC (irps5401) on ZCU104 can't afford DPU running on heavy loading. You may see crash or hang on heavy loading.
   - Please refer to [DPU TRD Known issues](https://github.com/Xilinx/Vitis-AI/blob/master/dsa/DPU-TRD/prj/Vitis/README.md#553-known-issues) for more information.
