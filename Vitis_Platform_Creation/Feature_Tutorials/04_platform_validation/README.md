## Extensible platform validation general outline

No matter user use Vitis flow or Vitis export to Vivado flow to develop their acceleration application, the extensible hardware platform (XSA) which provides the hardware environment for application kernels is the development start point.
Thereby, hardware platform validation is necessary before going to next stage.

>Note: For Vitis export to Vivado flow, please refer to [Vitis Export To Vivado](../03_Vitis_Export_To_Vivado/README.md).

Hardware platform validation can be divided into two stage. The first stage is to validate the peripherals to ensure a bootable design.

The second stage is to validate the platform interface exported to kernel. Extensible hardware platform provides the interface like: AXI master interface, AXI slave interface, AXI streaming interface and interrupt interface for kernels. These interface guarantee the kernel control, memory access, large data moving and interrupt control. Validating the platform, that is to validate the interfaces provided to kernels.

![missing image](images/interface.svg)

The interfaces exported for extensible XSA is linked by V++ linker to connect PL or AIE kernels. V++ linker supports to take XSA or XPFM as input. Linking a kernel with the hardware XSA and testing from kernel side would be the easiest way for validation.

The validation can include following tests:

   1. access all memory region from kernel side to verify the AXI slave memory interface; 
   2. generate interrupt signal to PS side from kernel side to verify the interrupt connection; 

**Note**: This method can be applied to all the custom platform.

In this module we will explain how to verify a platform and go through the two stages.

## Platform hardware validation

## Stage I Base bootable design verification


### Step 1: Prepare a hardware design

Please follow the instructions in [Versal platform creation tutorial-Step1](../../Design_Tutorials/03_Edge_VCK190/step1.md) to prepare a custom hardware platform. You can skip the optional steps. Or you can export the XSA file from your Vivado project.

>Note: If you created a platform project like the above steps, you need to change it to a normal project to complete bootable design verifications.

### Step 2: Validate the hardware design

#### Test1: Go through implementation

   As the hardware platform is created from part support example design or from scratch, it's recommended to run through implementation and device image generation to find errors in early stage for the base bootable design. The platform doesn't need the implementation results, the implementation is used for design validation only.

<details>
  <summary><b>Show Detailed Steps of Implementation</b></summary>


1. Validate the Block Design

   - Click ***Validate Design (F6)*** button in block diagram toolbar.

2. Create HDL Wrapper

   - In Sources tab, right click system.bd and select ***Create HDL Wrapper***. In the pop-up window, select ***Let Vivado Manage***.

3. Select ***Run implementation*** from Flow Navigator, Click **OK** in **Launch Runs** setup dialog.

4. Generate Device Image (For Method2)

   - Click ***Generate Device Image*** in Flow Navigator

   - Click ***Yes*** if it pops up a message to say *No Implementation Results Available*.

   ![missing image](./images/vivado_no_imp_avail.png)

   - Click ***OK*** for default options for Launch Runs dialogue.

   It takes a while to generate block diagram and run through implementation.

   PDI is generated in `custom_hardware_platform.runs/impl_1/`

5. Export fixed XSA file (For Test3)

   a) Click Menu ***File -> Export -> Export Hardware***. Click Next.

   b) Select Output to ***Include Device Image***. Click Next.

   c) Set output XSA file name as `xsa_fixed` and the directory. Click Next.

   d) Click Finish
</details>

#### Test2: Validate PDI on Hardware

As the hardware platform is created from part support example design, it's recommended to test the device image (PDI) on hardware to make sure the device initialization configuration is set correctly as well. This is not a required step for platform creation, but it can reduce issues you find in the last platform validation stage.

<details>
<summary><b>Show Detailed Steps of how to download the PDI file</b></summary>

- Connect hardware server in XSCT

   ```tcl
   # If JTAG cable is connected locally
   connect

   # If JTAG cable is connected on another server, launch hw_server on that server then connect to that remote hardware server
   connect -url TCP:<SERVER NAME or IP>:3121
   ```

- Download PDI in XSCT

   ```tcl
   device program <PDI file>
   ```

PDI program should download without errors. If any error occurs in XSCT console, please check block design settings.

Here's the sample prints on UART console of VCK190 board

   Please refer to [Embedded Design Tutorial](https://github.com/Xilinx/Embedded-Design-Tutorials/blob/master/docs/Introduction/Versal-EDT/docs/2-cips-noc-ip-config.rst#creating-a-hello-world-application-for-the-arm-cortex-a72-on-ocm) to create a bare-metal application based on the fixed XSA file and run on board to test the peripherals.
   
   Application templates can choose the Peripheral or memory test:

   ![missing image](images/templates.PNG)

## Stage II Extensible platform interface verification
General steps are as following:

### Step 1: Prepare a Hardware Platform

Please follow the instructions in [Versal platform creation tutorial-Step1](../../Design_Tutorials/03_Edge_VCK190/step1.md) to prepare a custom hardware platform. You can skip the optional steps. Or you can export the XSA file from your Vivado project.


### Step 2: Utilize the V++ linker to link a kernel and generate fixed XSA file

V++ usage is like the following:

  ```bash
  v++ -l <kernel> --platform <extensible xsa> -s -g  -t <target> -o fixed.xsa
  ```
  The options is explained like the following:

   -  `-l`: run a link mode and specify the kernel 
   -  `--platform`: specify the extensible XSA file
   -  `-s`: do not delete the intermedia file
   -  `-g`: generate code for debugging
   -  `-t`: specify the target, HW or HW emulation
   -  `-o`: specify the output file name

Linking XSA file directly can provide fast track for hardware developers to iterate hardware designs​.

### Step 3: Create a platform with standalone domain

In this step, you will package the hardware XSA with software components in the Vitis IDE. Follow the instructions in [Versal platform creation tutorial-Step2](../../Design_Tutorials/03_Edge_VCK190/step2.md). Please set operating system to **standalone**.


### Step 4: Create application base on the platform

Please refer to [Versal platform creation tutorial-Step3](../../Design_Tutorials/03_Edge_VCK190/step3.md) to create an application based on the platform created in step3. In this application we should do the following:

   1. Access the kernel registers from PS side to determine whether the kernel is accessible, and thus indirectly determine whether AXI mater interface is working or not.
   2. Kernel accesses the memory to determine whether the memory is accessible or not from kernel side, and thus indirectly determine whether AXI slave interface for memory is working or not.
   3. Kernel triggers interrupt to PS and PS try to capture the interrupt to determine whether the interrupt connection is correct or not, and thus indirectly determine whether the interrupt is working or not. 

   One reference design example is provided in the `ref_files` directory for your reference. Next we will demonstrate how to use the examples provided in ref_files directory to do validation.

### Extensible platform validation demonstration

#### Test example 1: Interrupt connection check

   In this test we will make a incorrect design manually and see whether it can report this error or not.

   1. Please follow the instructions in [Versal platform creation tutorial-Step1](../../Design_Tutorials/03_Edge_VCK190/step1.md) to create a custom hardware platform. You can skip the optional steps. Before going through `Generate block design` step, delete the connection between `axi_intc_0.irq` and `pl_ps_irq0` like the following. Then export the platform according to the steps.


   ![missing image](images/delete_irq_connection.PNG)

   2. Go to the `ref_files` directory.

   ```bash
   cd ref_files/pl_validation
   make all EXTENSIBLE_XSA=/Vitis-Tutorials/Vitis_Platform_Creation/Design_Tutorials/03_Edge_VCK190/ref_files/step1_vivado/build/vivado/custom_hardware_platform_hw.xsa  TARGET=hw #the XSA is exported from last step
   ```
   Please refer to [Versal platform creation tutorial-Step3](../../Design_Tutorials/03_Edge_VCK190/step3.md) to burn the image and connect your board.

   <details>
   <summary><strong>Expected log on board is as following:</strong></summary>
   
   ```bash
   #Beginning test
   #Beginning PS to Memory test
        INFO::PS to memory access check: PASS!
   #Beginning PS to Kernel (register) test
        INFO::Try to wite MM2S kernel offset is 10, Value is a
        INFO::kernel register  is accessible
        INFO::Kernel register access check: PASS!
   #Beginning PL Kernel to Memory test
        INFO::PL kernels are initialized

   #Beginning to do interrupt check
        INFO::We are trying to move data in interrupt mode
        INFO::GIC and INC are initialized

        ERROR::Interrupt is not detected in PS side
        ERROR::Please check whether the interrupt is exported in your platform and the interrupt connection in Vivado block design!
   #End
   ```

   </details>  

   This is what we expected log. It report the interrupt connection error as expected. You can try with other extensible hardware platforms.


#### Test Example 2: AIE test

   In this test we will focus on the AI engine side. We will test whether the AI engine is working correctly or not.

   1. Please follow the instructions in [Versal platform creation tutorial-Step1](../../Design_Tutorials/03_Edge_VCK190/step1.md) to create a custom hardware platform. You can skip the optional steps.

   2. Go to the `ref_files` directory.

   ```bash
   cd ref_files/aie_validation
   make all EXTENSIBLE_XSA=/Vitis-Tutorials/Vitis_Platform_Creation/Design_Tutorials/03_Edge_VCK190/ref_files/step1_vivado/build/vivado/custom_hardware_platform_hw.xsa  TARGET=hw #the XSA is exported from last step
   ```
   Please refer to [Versal platform creation tutorial-Step3](../../Design_Tutorials/03_Edge_VCK190/step3.md) to burn the image and connect your board.
