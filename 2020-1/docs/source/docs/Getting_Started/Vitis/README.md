This tutorial is organized in 5 parts and is designed to walk you through all the key aspects of the Vitis flow.

* [**Part 1**](./Part1.md) covers all the essential concepts of the Vitis FPGA acceleration flow in under 10 minutes

* [**Part 2**](./Part2.md) guides you through the process of installing the Vitis tools, platforms and runtime library.

* [**Part 3**](./Part3.md) explains the source code of vector-add example used in the rest of the tutorial

* [**Part 4**](./Part4.md) describes the commands required to compile, link and run the example on your acceleration card

* [**Part 5**](./Part5.md) gives an overview of Vitis Analyzer and shows how to open and analyze reports



Vitis provides a unified flow for developing FPGA accelerated application targeted to either data-center or embedded platforms. This tutorial provides instructions for building and running on both ZCU102 and Alveo U200 cards. These instructions can be easily adapted to other Xilinx cards.

> NOTE: This tutorial requires Vitis 2020.1 or later to run.
