# Essential Concepts for Building and Running the Accelerated Application

## Introduction

The following labs will introduce you to the essential concepts for building and running an accelerated application using the Vitis™ core development kit.

## Before You Begin

The labs in this tutorial use:

* BASH Linux shell commands.
* 2020.1 Vitis core development kit release and the *xilinx_u250_qdma_201920_1* platform. If necessary, it can be modified to use other software releases and platforms.

>**IMPORTANT:**  
>
> * Before running any of the examples, make sure you have installed the Vitis core development kit, and the Alveo Data Center accelerator card development platform, as described in [Installation](https://www.xilinx.com/cgi-bin/docs/rdoc?v=2020.1;t=vitis+doc;d=vhc1571429852245.html) in the Application Acceleration Development flow of the Vitis Unified Software Platform Documentation (UG1416).
>* If you run applications on Xilinx® Alveo™ Data Center accelerator cards, ensure the card and software drivers have been correctly installed by following the instructions on the [Alveo Portfolio page](https://www.xilinx.com/products/boards-and-kits/alveo.html).

### Accessing the Tutorial Reference Files

1. To access the reference files, type the following into a terminal: `git clone https://github.com/Xilinx/Vitis-Tutorials`.
2. Navigate to the `Pathway3` directory, and then access the `reference-files` directory.

## Next Steps

You should work through the labs in the following order.

* [Building an Application](./BuildingAnApplication.md)
* [Running Software and Hardware Emulation](./Emulation.md)
* [Generating Profile and Trace Reports](./ProfileAndTraceReports.md)
* [Executing in Hardware](./HardwareExec.md)

<!--
1. [Building an Application](./BuildingAnApplication.md): Learn how to build the host program and hardware kernel for an application.
2. [Running Software and Hardware Emulation](./Emulation.md): Run hardware and software emulation on an application.
3. [Generating Profile and Trace Reports](./ProfileAndTraceReports.md): Learn how to generate profiling reports to better understand the performance of an application.
4. [Executing in Hardware](./HardwareExec.md): Finally, execute an application on the Alveo Data Center accelerator card.
