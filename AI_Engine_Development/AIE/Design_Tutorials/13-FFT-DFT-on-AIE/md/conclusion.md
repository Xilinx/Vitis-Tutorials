## Conclusion

This tutorial provides a detailed review of several methods for implementing highperformance
FFT and DFT algorithms on the AI Engine array. These include the Stockham
algorithm implemented by the Vitis DSPlib or coded by hand using the AI Engine API and a
direct-form DFT for small point sizes implemented as a vector-matrix multiplication. Both
approaches can achieve a broad spectrum of FFT and DFT point sizes and throughput rates for
practical applications.
