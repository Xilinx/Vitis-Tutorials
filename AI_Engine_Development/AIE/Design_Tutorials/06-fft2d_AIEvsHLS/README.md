## Introduction

The AMD Versal&trade; adaptive SoC is a fully software programmable, heterogeneous compute platform that combines the following:

- Scalar Engines (a processor subsystem (PS) that includes Arm&reg; processors).
- Adaptable Engines (programmable logic (PL) and memory).
- Intelligent Engines (including both including both AI and DSP Engines).

This tutorial performs two implementations of a system-level design: one with an AI Engine and the other with HLS using the DSP Engines. In each implementation, the tutorial takes you through the hardware emulation and hardware flow in the context of a complete Versal adaptive SoC system design.

A Makefile is provided for each implementation. It can be used to create the design for `cint16` and `acfloat` datatypes for various point sizes (32 x 64, 64 x 128, 128 x 256, 256 x 512, and 1024 x 2048), different numbers of fft_2d HLS kernel/AI Engine graph instances (1, 5, and 10), and lastly for different targets (hw_emu and hw).

The design documentation demonstrates hardware and software design details, including the methodology for each implementation, elaborating on the functional partitioning. The compilation, execution, measurement steps, and observations are given.

  <summary>Design Overview</summary> 
 
### Design Overview

This design aims to implement a 2D-FFT algorithm performed on (for example) a 1024 x 2048 matrix using 1024- and 2048-point 1D-FFT kernels. The pseudo-code to implement the algorithm is shown in the following example:

```
x = rand(a,b);         % Create matrix of dimensions m x n

x_2fft = fft2(x);      % Reference generation, 2 dimensional FFT of matrix 'x'

FFT2D, using 1D – FFT.
x_row = fft(x);        % Row wise 1D-FFT
x_row = x_row.’;       % Transpose
x_col = fft(x_row);    % Row wise 1D-FFT
x_col = x_col.’;       % Transpose

x_2fft - x_col         % Calculate the error difference
```

In calculating each 1D-FFT, one dimension is kept constant while the other is computed. The transpose function is applied after each 1D-FFT compute. The transpose function moves the entry along each element of the dimension to the corresponding element of the other dimension. A golden data set is generated as a reference, and the error difference is calculated.

A similar algorithm is deployed in the two implementations using either the AI Engines or HLS targeting the PL and DSP Engines. The design compiles through the Vitis compiler, creates a PetaLinux-based platform using a script, and generates the PDI and host application. Instead of the transpose part, however, a PL-based data generator and checker (referred to as a data mover) is used to give an impulse (value = 1 or 1.5, depending on the cint16 or cfloat datatype) input to the row-wise 1D-FFT and check its output against the expected FFT output for the same (the first row containing all 1s and remaining 0s).

The transposed pattern generated within the PL is streamed as input to the col-wise 1D-FFT. Its output is checked against the expected output (all 1s). The data mover kernel returns the total error count in both stages to the host application, which is used to declare a pass or fail of the test case.

To help you compare the methodology of the AI Engine and HLS-based implementations, the design-build process can be modified to analyze how each implementation scales with different numbers of instances (x1, x5, and x10) of various matrix array dimensions (rows x cols = 32 x 64, 64 x 128, 128 x 256, 256 x 512, and 1024 x 2048). 

A similar set of harnesses is developed and maintained between the two implementations. This allows you to generate and check input/output vectors using the PL-based data mover kernels and moving data to and from the AI and HLS kernels. In both cases, Xilinx Runtime (XRT) running on A72 controls data flow in compute, and data mover kernels through graph control APIs. These graph control APIs control the AI Engine kernels and HLS APIs, which control the HLS/PL kernels.

<summary>Platform</summary> 

### Platform

Before beginning the tutorial, make sure you have read and followed the [Vitis Software Platform Release Notes (v2023.2)](https://docs.xilinx.com/r/en-US/ug1393-vitis-application-acceleration/Vitis-Software-Platform-Release-Notes) for setting up software and installing the VCK190 base platform.

This tutorial targets the [VCK190 production board](https://www.xilinx.com/products/boards-and-kits/vck190.html). If you have already purchased this board, download the necessary files from the lounge and ensure you have the correct licenses installed. If you do not have a board and the required license, contact your AMD sales contact.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Setting Up the Environment</summary>
 
### Setting up the Environment

When the Vitis software platform elements are installed, update the shell environment script. Set the environment variables to your system-specific paths.

To set up XRT, if you have not done this already, run the following command:

```
* source \<XRT-Location\>/setup.sh
```

In the design directory of each implementation, edit `env_setup.sh` script with your file paths and source the environment script:  

```bash
source env_setup.sh
``` 

The script sets up the environment variables and sources scripts explained below:

1. The `PLATFORM_REPO_PATHS` environment variable is based on where you downloaded the platform.
2. The `XILINX_TOOLS_LOCATION` path to the Xilinx tools is used to source the `settings64.sh` script.
3. The `XLNX_VERSAL` path to the `xilinx-versal-common-v2023.2` directory is used in the step below.
4. The platform is set up by running the `xilinx-versal-common-v2023.2/environment-setup-cortexa72-cortexa53-xilinx-linux` script as provided in the platform download. This script sets up the `SDKTARGETSYSROOT` and `CXX` variables. If the script is not present, you _must_ run the `xilinx-versal-common-v2023.2/sdk.sh` script.
5. `DSPLIB_ROOT` is the path to the downloaded Vitis DSP Libraries. This is only required for the AI Engine implementation.
6. In the script, you can optionally set up an `XRT_ROOT` environment variable, pointing to XRT - RPMs, which can be packaged in the Vitis compiler packaging step. If not set up, this environment variable is automatically excluded from packaging.
7. The script also sets up the `PLATFORM` variable pointing to the required `.xpfm` file of the target platform set by the variable `tgt_plat`.

## AI Engine and HLS Implementation Comparison

The following table compares a 1024 x 2048 point 10-instance FFT-2D design implemented using the AI Engines and HLS with DSP Engines respectively. It lists the throughput, resource utilization, power consumption, and performance in throughput/Watt for `cint16` implementations.

| Design Target | Aggregate Throughput<br/>(in MSPS) | Average Latency (in μs) | AIE Vector Cores | AIE Vector Load | Active Mem Banks /<br/> Mem R/W Rate | Active AIE Tiles | FF (Regs) /<br/> CLB LUTs | BRAMs | DSPs | Dynamic Power<br/>(in mW) | Performance per Watt<br/>(in MSPS/Watt) |
|:-------------:|:----------------------------------:|:-----------------------:|:----------------:|:---------------:|:------------------------------------:|:----------------:|:-------------------------:|:-----:|:----:|:-------------------------:|:---------------------------------------:|
| AIE           | 6215.528                           | 3546.4672               | 20              | 77%              | 420 /<br/>19%                        | 72               | 11360 /<br/> 3654         | 0     | 0    | 6781                      | 916.60936                              |
| HLS           | 4979.797                           | 4040.900                | NA              | NA               | NA                                   | NA               | 98899 /<br/> 61591        | 250   | 180  | 5800                      | 858.59                                 |

These observations give a clear indication of where the AI Engines in Versal can offer improvements:

* An almost 51% improvement in the aggregate throughput.
* Reduced latency by ~29%.
* Performance increase of ~2x to 1351 MSPS/Watt.
* Moving to AI Engine implementation reduces the PL and DSP resources considerably; 180 DSPs, ~98K FFs, ~61K LUTs, and 250 BRAMs are reduced to 46 AI Engines, 11k FFs, and 4K LUTs.

It is important to understand that those 46 AI Engines are not all required for the 2D-FFT compute: 20 AI Engines/vector cores are required for computation, and 26 AI Engines are required for the memory to store the FFT twiddle factors and also to enable connectivity around the array. The average load on these additional 26 AI Engine tiles is only 25%. This means that if your application needs it, these AI Engines can be shared with other functions to run sequentially, or they can use user constraints to better map and route this function to a reduced number of AI Engine tiles (see [this page](https://docs.xilinx.com/r/en-US/ug1076-ai-engine-environment/Mapper/Router-Methodology) for details on the AI Engine mapper/router).

Additionally, increasing the number of instances in the AI Engine design is easier than the HLS design, which runs into timing closure issues, especially for higher FFT point size designs.

**Measurement:**

1. AI Engine design resource utilization is measured using Xilinx Power Estimator (XPE) and AMD Vivado&trade; (report utilization under implementation for FFs and CLB LUTs). For the HLS design, resource utilization is measured using Vivado.
2. AI Engine power consumption is measured using XPE. HLS power consumption is measured using Vivado (report power under implementation).
3. Throughput is measured using viewing runtime profiling generated trace texts in `vitis_analyzer`.

For detailed instructions on taking measurements of the parameters, refer to the individual implementation section.
