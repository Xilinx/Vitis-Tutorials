## Design Tutorials

The AI Engine Development Design Tutorials showcase the two major phases of AI Engine application development: architecting the application and developing the kernels. Both phases are demonstrated in these tutorials.

The <a href="../README.md">**README**</a> of AI Engine Development contains important information including tool version, environment settings, and a table describing the platform, operating system, and supported features or flows of each tutorial. It is strongly recommended that you review details before starting to use the AIE tutorials.

We also illustrate how to trade off AI engine tile resource vs. throughput performance of the Stockham FFT in DSPlib using its <code>TP_CASC_LEN</code> and <code>TP_PARALLEL_POWER</code> template parameters. This is useful when configuring DSPlib FFT library instances to serve as part of a larger 2D FFT architecture.</td>
