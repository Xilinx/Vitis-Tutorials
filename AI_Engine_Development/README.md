### Design Tutorials

The methodology for developing optimized accelerated applications is comprised of two major phases: architecting the application, and developing the kernels. In the first phase, you make key decisions about the application architecture by determining which software functions should be accelerated onto ACAP kernels, how much parallelism can be achieved, and how to deliver it in code. In the second phase, you implement the kernels by structuring the source code, and applying the necessary build options s to create the kernel architecture needed to achieve the optimized performance target. The following examples illustrate the use of this methodology in real-world applications.

 <td>This tutorial uses the LeNet algorithm to implement a system-level design to perform image classification using the AI Engine and PL logic, including block RAM (BRAM). The design demonstrates functional partitioning between the AI Engine and PL. It also highlights memory partitioning and hierarchy among DDR memory, PL (BRAM) and AI Engine memory..</td>
