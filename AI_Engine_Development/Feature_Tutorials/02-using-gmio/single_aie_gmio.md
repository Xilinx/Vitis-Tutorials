## AI Engine GMIO Programming Model
This example introduces the AI Engine GMIO programming model. It includes three steps:

* [Step 1 - Synchronous GMIO Transfer](#Step-1---Synchronous-GMIO-Transfer)
* [Step 2 - Asynchronous GMIO transfer for Input and Synchronous GMIO transfer for Output](#Step-2---Asynchronous-GMIO-transfer-for-Input-and-Synchronous-GMIO-transfer-for-Output)
* [Step 3 - Asynchronous GMIO Transfer and Hardware flow](#Step-3---Asynchronous-GMIO-Transfer-and-Hardware-flow)

We will use AI Engine simulator event trace in each step to see how performance can be improved step by step. The last step introduces code to make GMIO work in hardware.

### Step 1 - Synchronous GMIO Transfer
In this step, we introduce the synchronous GMIO transfer mode. Change the working directory to `single_aie_gmio/step1`. Looking at the graph code `aie/graph.h`, it can be seen that the design has one output `out` and one input `din`, with an AI Engine kernel `weighted_sum_with_margin`.

    class mygraph: public adf::graph
    {
    private:
      adf::kernel k_m;
    public:
      adf::port<adf::direction::out> out;
      adf::port<adf::direction::in> din;
      mygraph()
      {
      k_m = adf::kernel::create(weighted_sum_with_margin);
      adf::connect<adf::window<1024,32>>(din, k_m.in[0]);
      adf::connect<adf::window<1024>>(k_m.out[0], out);
      adf::source(k_m) = "weighted_sum.cc";
      adf::runtime<adf::ratio>(k_m)= 0.9;
      };
    };

Examine the host code in `aie/graph.cpp`. It is seen that two `GMIO` ports, `gmioIn` and `gmioOut`, are instantiated and they are connected to the platform input and output. Then the graph is instantiated and connected to the platform.

    using namespace adf;
    GMIO gmioIn("gmioIn",64,1000);
    GMIO gmioOut("gmioOut",64,1000);
    adf::simulation::platform<1,1> platform(&gmioIn,&gmioOut);
    mygraph gr;
    adf::connect<> net0(gr.out, platform.sink[0]);
    adf::connect<> net1(platform.src[0], gr.din);

The GMIO instantiation `gmioIn` represents the DDR memory space to be read by the AI Engine and `gmioOut` represents the DDR memory space to be written by the AI Engine. The constructor specifies the logical name of the GMIO, burst length (that can be 64,
128, or 256 bytes) of the memory-mapped AXI4 transaction, and the required bandwidth in MB/s (here 1000 MB/s).

Inside the main function, two 256-element int32 arrays (1024 bytes) are allocated by `GMIO::malloc`. The `dinArray` points to the memory space to be read by the AI Engine and the `doutArray` points to the memory space to be written by the AI Engine. In Linux, the vitual address passed to `GMIO::gm2aie_nb`, `GMIO::aie2gm_nb`, `GMIO::gm2aie`, and `GMIO::aie2gm` must be allocated by `GMIO::malloc`. After the input data is allocated, it can be initialized.

    int32* dinArray=(int32*)GMIO::malloc(BLOCK_SIZE_in_Bytes);
    int32* doutArray=(int32*)GMIO::malloc(BLOCK_SIZE_in_Bytes);

`doutRef` is used for golden output reference. It can be allocated by a standard `malloc` because it does not involve GMIO transfer.

    int32* doutRef=(int32*)malloc(BLOCK_SIZE_in_Bytes);

`GMIO::gm2aie` and `GMIO::gm2aie_nb` are used to initiate read transfers from the AI Engine to DDR memory using memory-mapped AXI transactions. The first argument in `GMIO::gm2aie` and `GMIO::gm2aie_nb` is the pointer to the start address of the memory space for the transaction (here `dinArray`). The second argument is the transaction size in bytes. The memory space for the transaction must be within the memory space allocated by `GMIO::malloc`. Similarly, `GMIO::aie2gm` and `GMIO::aie2gm_nb` are used to initiate write transfers from the AI Engine to DDR memory. `GMIO::gm2aie_nb` and `GMIO::aie2gm_nb` are non-blocking functions that return immediately when the transaction is issued - they do not wait for the transaction to complete. In contrast, the functions, `GMIO::gm2aie` and `GMIO::aie2gm` behave in a blocking manner.

    gmioIn.gm2aie(dinArray,BLOCK_SIZE_in_Bytes);
    gr.run(ITERATION);
    gmioOut.aie2gm(doutArray,BLOCK_SIZE_in_Bytes);

The blocking transfer (`gmioIn.gm2aie`) has to be completed before `gr.run()` because the GMIO transfer is in synchronous mode here. But the window input of the graph (in PING-PONG manner by default) has only two buffers to store the received data. This means that at the maximum, two blocks of window input data can be transferred by GMIO blocking transfer. Otherwise, the `GMIO::gm2aie` will block the design. In this example program, `ITERATION` is set to one.

Because `GMIO::aie2gm()` is working in synchronous mode, the output processing can be done just after it is completed.

__Note:__ The memory is non-cachable for GMIO in Linux.

In the example program, the design runs four iterations in a loop. In the loop, pre-processing and post-processing are done before and after data transfer.

    for(int i=0;i<4;i++){
      //pre-processing
      for(int j=0;j<ITERATION*1024/4;j++){
        dinArray[j]=j+i;
      }

      gmioIn.gm2aie(dinArray,BLOCK_SIZE_in_Bytes);
      gr.run(ITERATION);
      gmioOut.aie2gm(doutArray,BLOCK_SIZE_in_Bytes);

      //post-processing
      ref_func(dinArray,coeff,doutRef,ITERATION*1024/4);
      for(int j=0;j<ITERATION*1024/4;j++){
        if(doutArray[j]!=doutRef[j]){
          std::cout<<"ERROR:dout["<<j<<"]="<<doutArray[j]<<",gold="<<doutRef[j]<<std::endl;
          error++;
        }
      }
    }

When PS has completed processing, the memory space allocated by `GMIO::malloc` can be released by `GMIO::free`.

    GMIO::free(dinArray);
    GMIO::free(doutArray);

#### Run AI Engine compiler and AI Engine simulator
Run the following make command to compile the design graph `libadf.a` and launch the AI Engine simulator:

	make aiesim

Notice that "--dump-vcd" option is added to the AI Engine simulator command. Use `vitis_analyzer` to open AI Engine simulator run result.

	vitis_analyzer ./aiesimulator_output/default.aierun_summary

Click the `Trace` tab in the Vitisâ„¢ analyzer. The events are shown as follows:

![Event trace result](./images/picture1.png)

The red arrow denotes the dependency between data transfer and kernel execution. It can be seen that the data transfer and kernel execution are performed in a sequential manner. The time required for kernel execution is much longer than that for data transfer. Next, let us overlay data transfer and kernel execution with a vectorized kernel.

### Step 2 - Asynchronous GMIO Transfer for Input and Synchronous GMIO Transfer for Output
In the previous step, it was identified that the sequential manner of data transfer and kernel execution is the main bottleneck of the design performance. In this step, the AI Engine kernel is replaced with a vectorized version to reduce kernel execution time. Change the working directory to `single_aie_gmio/step2`. The vectorized kernel code is in `aie/weighted_sum.cc`.

Besides the kernel update, we try to do asynchronous GMIO transfers for inputs, but leave synchronous GMIO transfers for outputs in this step. The purpose of mixing synchronous and asynchronous GMIO transfers is to overlap data transfer and kernel execution. Thus, the performance is further improved.

Examine the code in main function `aie/graph.cpp`. This time `ITERATION` is four, and graph is executed by four iterations with `gr.run(ITERATION)` and the GMIO transaction from memory to AI Engine is through non-blocking GMIO API `gmioIn.gm2aie_nb(dinArray,BLOCK_SIZE_in_Bytes);`. It does not block the following executions. However, we will keep using blocking GMIO API for output data.

	//pre-processing
	...
	gmioIn.gm2aie_nb(dinArray,BLOCK_SIZE_in_Bytes);//Transfer all blocks input data at a time
	gr.run(ITERATION); //ITERATION=4
	gmioOut.aie2gm(doutArray,BLOCK_SIZE_in_Bytes);//Transfer all blocks output data at a time
	...
	//post-processing

Although a non-blocking GMIO API is used to transfer the input data, there is no need for explicit synchronization between data transfer and kernel execution. The synchronization between input data transfer and kernel execution is guaranteed by the window buffer, meaning that every iteration of kernel execution will wait for the block of input data to be ready. The output data is synchronized using a blocking GMIO API. After the blocking API returns, the data is guaranteed to be available in DDR memory and the post-processing sequence can be safely started.

#### Run AI Engine compiler and AI Engine simulator
Run the following make command to compile the design graph `libadf.a` and launch the AI Engine simulator:

	make aiesim

Use `vitis_analyzer` to open AI Engine simulator run result.

	vitis_analyzer ./aiesimulator_output/default.aierun_summary

Click the `Trace` tab in the Vitis Analyzer. The events are shown as follows:

![Event trace result](./images/picture2.png)

The red arrow denotes the dependency between data transfer and kernel execution and orange rectangle shows overlapping between data transfer and kernel execution. It can be seen that the kernel execution time has been reduced (by comparing to data transfer) and data transfer and kernel execution are overlapping. In the next step, let us explore asynchronous output data transfer and its synchronization mechanism.

### Step 3 - Asynchronous GMIO Transfer and Hardware Flow
In this step, we will see how to asynchronously transfer output data with non-blocking GMIO API, and how to use `GMIO::wait` to perform data synchronization. In addition, we will see how to run the AI Engine program with GMIO in hardware.

Change the working directory to `single_aie_gmio/step3`. Examine `aie/graph.cpp`. The main difference in code is as follows:

	gmioIn.gm2aie_nb(dinArray,BLOCK_SIZE_in_Bytes);//Transfer all blocks input data at a time
	gr.run(ITERATION);
	gmioOut.aie2gm_nb(doutArray,BLOCK_SIZE_in_Bytes);//Transfer all blocks output data at a time
	//PS can do other tasks here when data is transferring
	gmioOut.wait();

__Note:__ `gmioOut.aie2gm_nb()` will return immediately after it has been called without waiting for the data transfer to be completed. PS can do other tasks after non-blocking API call when data is transferring. Then, it needs `gmioOut.wait();` to do the data synchronization. After `GMIO::wait`, the output data is in memory and can be processed by the host application.

To make GMIO work in hardware flow, the following code needs to be added to the main function before graph execution and GMIO data transfer:

	#if !defined(__AIESIM__) && !defined(__X86SIM__)
		#include "adf/adf_api/XRTConfig.h"
		#include "experimental/xrt_kernel.h"
		// Create XRT device handle for ADF API
		char* xclbinFilename = argv[1];
		auto dhdl = xrtDeviceOpen(0);//device index=0
		xrtDeviceLoadXclbinFile(dhdl,xclbinFilename);
		xuid_t uuid;
		xrtDeviceGetXclbinUUID(dhdl, uuid);
		adf::registerXRT(dhdl, uuid);
	#endif

The macro `__AIESIM__` is automatically defined by tool when running AI Engine simulator. The macro `__X86SIM__` is automatically defined by tool when running x86simulator. Using the guard macro `__AIESIM__` and `__X86SIM__` as shown in the previous code, this part of code is not used in AI Engine simulator, but used in hardware flow and hardware emulation flow to make those flows work correctly.

At the end of the program, close the device using the XRT API `xrtDeviceClose()`.

	#if !defined(__AIESIM__) && !defined(__X86SIM__)
		xrtDeviceClose(dhdl);
	#endif

#### Run AI Engine simulator and hardware flow
Run the following make command to compile the design graph `libadf.a` and launch the AI Engine simulator:

	make aiesim

Use `vitis_analyzer` to open AI Engine simulator run result.

	vitis_analyzer ./aiesimulator_output/default.aierun_summary

Click the `Trace` tab in the Vitis Analyzer. The events are displayed as shown in the following figure:

![Event trace result](./images/picture3.png)

It can be seen that the data transfer and kernel execution are overlapping.

Run the following make command to build image for hardware:

	make package TARGET=hw

After the package is done, run the following commands in the Linux prompt after booting Linux from an SD card:

	export XILINX_XRT=/usr
	cd /mnt/sd-mmcblk0p1
	./host.exe a.xclbin

The host code is self-checking. It will check the output data against the golden data. If the output data matches the golden data after the run is complete, it will print the following:

	PASS!
