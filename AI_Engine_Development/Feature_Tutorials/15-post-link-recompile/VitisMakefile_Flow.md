# Lab 2: Post-Link Recompile of an AI Engine Application</h1>

## Initialization

All labs rely on a set of source files that are available in the `Files` sub-directory:

- `AIE` contains the source files for the AI Engine application.
- `AIE2` contains the source files for the AI Engine application with location constraints for one of the AI Engine kernels.
- `Constraints` contains the PLIO constraints file for the second phase.
- `data` contains data files used to verify application functionality.
- `HwLink` contains a system configuration file to link AI Engine and PL kernels.
- `PL` contains all PL kernels (`mm2s`, `s2mm`, and `polar_clip`).
- `PS` contains the host (A72) application that runs the PL kernels, launches the graph, and verifies the output.

Go to the lab directory:

```BASH
cd WithIntermediatePlatform
```

## Phase 1: Creating a Fixed Platform from an AI Engine Application and PL Kernels

This lab uses the same files as the [Vitis IDE flow](VitisIDE_Flow.md), but all the operations are completed within a terminal.

1. To complete phase 1, change directory: `cd Phase1`.

   This directory contains a single file, which is a Makefile. Open it in any editor or display it in the terminal using `more`, `less`, or `cat`. The Makefile contains three stages:

   * `kernels`: To build the PL kernels. The output is a number of XO files, which are packaged RTL kernels.

   * `aie`: To build the AI Engine graph. The output is the file `libadf.a`, which is the compiled graph with all the PL/AI Engine interfaces.

   * `link`: To link the AI Engine array design with the PL design. This stage creates the XCLBIN and the XSA files.

There are also optional stages to simulate the AI Engine application using the `aiesim` target and `run_emu` to launch hardware emulation that includes all the PL kernels.


The platform directory, `$PLATFORM_REPO_PATHS` is initialized in  `env_setup.h`. It should contain the platform **xilinx_vck190_base_202220_1**.

In the terminal, type `make clean phase1` and all the required stages (`kernels`, `aie`, and `link`) will be run in the terminal as well as hardware emulation (`package` and `run_emu`).

Check the placement of the AI Engine kernels using Vitis Analyzer and opening the `graph.aiecompile_summary` file.

**Note:** The hardware emulation does not launch automatically. You have to launch it manually:

```
cd /run/media/mmcblk0p1
./host.exe a.xclbin
```

At the end of the simulation the following message is displayed:

```

```

You can get out of QEMU by hitting **Ctrl** + **a x**.




## Phase 2: Using a Platform Generated by Vitis and Modifying the AI Engine Application

Phase 2 contains the following stages:

 1. `aie2`: As in the previous phase, this stage builds an AI Engine application, but in this case it uses the new platform constraints.

 2. `host`: Compile the PS application.

 3. `package2`: Create the PDI to load onto the device (`hw_emu`).

 4. `run_emu`: Launch the simulation and verifies that the output is still correct.


Platform creation is based on a base platform which is specified in the `env_setup.sh` file.


Generic Versal and specific platform directories are defined in the `Makefile`:

```Makefile
# Platform
VERSAL_SW := ${PLATFORM_DIR}/sw/versal/xilinx-versal-common-v2022.2
BASE_PLATFORM ?= ${PLATFORM_DIR}/$(PFM_NAME)/$(PFM_NAME).xpfm
PLATFORM_SW := ${PLATFORM_DIR}/$(PFM_NAME)/sw/$(PFM_NAME)

IMAGE   := ${PLATFORM_REPO_PATHS}/sw/versal/xilinx-versal-common-v2022.2/Image
```

The new platform is named `Phase1_container`. It has been created by the `vitis --link` stage during Phase1. The `.xsa` file contains all the constraints corresponding to  the interface and is located in the directory `Phase1`:

```Makefile
# New platform
PFM := Phase1_container
# Phase 1 output
XCLBIN := ../Phase1/$(PFM).xclbin
XSA    := ../Phase1/$(PFM).xsa

```

The first stage, `make aie2`, consists of generating the AI Engine application graph using the previously created `.xsa` file. The kernel itself has not changed but a kernel location constraint has been added to the graph so that you can see a big difference in the kernel placement. Check this new placement using Vitis Analyzer on the compile summary.

The second stage, `make host`, is straightforward and you can see that the first object file that is created is `aie_control_xrt.o`. It is built from the CPP file that has been generated by the second stage.

The third stage, `make package2`, has various outputs. Among them is a file named `launch_hw_emu.sh`, which is used to run the hardware emulation in the last stage.

The fourth and final stage, `make run_emu`, starts the hardware emulation that will also verify the correctness of the output.


## Perform On-Board Testing

1. To perform on-board testing, the same stages can be replicated but with a different target:

- For phase 1, type `make TARGET=hw clean phase1`.
- For phase 2, type `make TARGET=hw phase2`.

2. When the phase 2 process is finished, an `sd_card.img` file has been created and can be used as in the [Direct Recompile Makefile](DirectRecompileMakefile_Flow.md) flow.

3. To launch the program on the board, type the following command:

```
cd /run/media/mmcblk0p1
./host.exe a.xclbin
```
