# Introduction

In this section of the tutorial, you will learn how to build a PS bare-metal application using the XSA created in the previous step and then build, as well as run the complete system.

### Step 1. Create a New Platform in the Bare-metal Domain

1. Open the Vitis IDE with the same workspace directory as the previous step. Click ***File → New →  Platform Project***.

2. Set the Platform Project Name to ***AIE_A-to-Z_pfm_vck190*** and click ***Next***.

3. Use the XSA generated in the previous step that you can find in `workspace/simple_application_system_hw_link/Hardware/binary_container_1.xsa`, set ***standalone*** as ***Operating system*** and ***CIPS_0_pspmc_0_psv_cortexa72_0*** as ***Processor***, and click ***Finish***.

4. Build the platform.

### Step 2. Build the Baremetal AI Engine Control Application

1. Create a new application by clicking on ***New → Application Project***.

2. Select ***AIE_A-to-Z_pfm_vck190*** as the platform.

3. Set the name for the application (example `A-to-Z_app`), select the A72_0 processor domain (`CIPS_0_pspmc_0_psv_cortexa72_0`), and click ***Next***.

4. On the next page, select ***standalone*** for the ***domain***.

5. Finally, select the ***Empty Application (C++)*** template and click ***Finish***.

6. Right-click on the ```src``` folder under the ***A-to-Z_app*** project and click ***Import Sources***.

7. Import the `aie_control.cpp` file from the AI Engine application project (`simple_application/Hardware/Work/ps/c_rts/aie_control.cpp`).

8. Import the following source files from the `src` folder

   * `main.cpp`
   * `platform.cpp`
   * `platform.h`
   * `platform_config.h`

    ![missing image](images/ps_app_import.png)

Go through the `main.cpp` file. You can see that the code is initializing the input data and the memory space for the output data. One thing to note is the use of the `.init()` and `.run()` APIs to control the AI Engine.

```
printf("Starting AIE Graph\n");
printf("Graph Initialization\n");
mygraph.init();
printf("Done \n");
printf("- \n");

printf("Running Graph for 4 iterations\n");
mygraph.run(4);
```

There are two options to enable an AI Engine graph from a system:
* Enable the graph in the PDI. This means that the graph will be started during BOOT and will run forever.
* Enable the AI Engine graph from the PS program using `<graph>.init()` and `<graph>.run()` APIs. This is what we are using in this case.

9. Right-click on A72 PS application (`A-to-Z_app)` and select ***C/C++ Build Settings***.

  ![missing image](images/ps_app_cfg1.png)

10. In the directories section under ARM v8 g++ compiler, add the directory for the AI Engine application:

  -  The sources folder for the AI Engine application (`${workspace_loc:/simple_application/src}`)

     ![missing image](images/212_ps_app_cfg2.png)

And make sure the `${env_var:XILINX_VITIS}/aietools/include` is already added in the directory settings.

11.Modify the Linker Script to increase the heap size for AIE library

  - In the Project Explorer, expand the A-to-z_app.

  - In the src directory, double-click `lscript.ld` to open the linker script for this project.

  - In the linker script modify the Heap size to `0x100000` (1MB).

12. Build the A72 PS application (`A-to-Z_app`) .     

### Step 3. Build the Full System

1. Click ***simple_application_system.sprj***. Add the following options in the ***Packaging options*** box:

```
--package.ps_elf ../../A-to-Z_app/Debug/A-to-Z_app.elf,a72-0 --package.defer_aie_run
```

  ![missing image](images/package_option.png)

>**Note**: The option  `--package.defer_aie_run` is required when running the AI Engine graph from the PS (see the [Versal ACAP AI Engine Programming Environment User Guide (UG1076)](https://docs.xilinx.com/r/en-US/ug1076-ai-engine-environment/Integrating-the-Application-Using-the-Vitis-Tools-Flow)).

2. Build the ***simple_application_system*** project.


### Step 4. Run the System

We have two ways to run the application.

A: Use Jtag to launch the application.

   1. Set up your board with proper connection of power cable, JTAG USB cable, UART USB cable and set BOOT MODE to JTAG.

   2. Right-click on the ***simple_application_system*** and click ***Run As → Launch Hardware***.

         ![missing image](images/run-on-hw.png)

   3. You should see the application running successfully with no error.

         ![missing image](images/hw_output.png)

B: Use SD card to run the application.

   1. Set up your board with proper connection of power cable, JTAG USB cable, UART USB cable and set BOOT MODE to SD Boot.

   2. Right-click on the ***simple_application_system*** and expand Hardware.In the `package_no_aie_debug` directory you would find BOOT.BIN file.

        > We can find BOOT.BIN in **package** and **package_no_aie_debug** directory. The BOOT.BIN in **package** directory is for hardware debug purpose. It stops AI Engine after loading and waits for the run instruction from the debugger. The one in the **package_no_aie_debug** directory is for free running. So we choose BOOT.BIN in **package_no_aie_debug** directory for SD Card free running.

   3. Copy BOOT.BIN to your SD card FAT32 partition. (If you do not know BOOT.BIN location, you can right click BOOT.BIN and select properties. It will show the file location directory.)

         ![missing image](images/package_no_aie_build.PNG)

   4. Insert your SD card into your board and power on your board.

   5. You should see the application running successfully with no error.

## Summary

In this tutorial, you have performed an end-to-end flow to create a platform based on the VCK190 board, added an AI Engine kernel and PL kernels into the system, and built a PS bare-metal application to run on it.
