# A to Z Bare-metal Flow: Introduction

## Platforms

A platform is the starting point of your design and will be used to build Vitis™ software platform applications.

In this first section of the tutorial an example of how to create a new platform is shown. This starts with building the hardware system using the AI Engine in the Vivado® Design Suite.

This is in most ways a traditional Vivado design. You are building the platform, that is, the part of the design that you do not want the Vitis tools to configure or modify. This can include completely unrelated logic, any hierarchy you want to have in the design, but there are some rules that you must follow:

- Your design must contain an IP integrator block diagram containing the CIPS, NOC, and other infrastructure IP
- Your design must have at least one clock that you will expose to Vitis for use with any kernels that it adds
This clock must have an associated `proc_sys_reset` block.

This tutorial targets the VCK190 ES board (see https://www.xilinx.com/products/boards-and-kits/vck190.html). This board is currently available via early access. If you have already purchased this board, download the necessary files from the lounge and ensure you have the correct licenses installed. If you do not have a board and ES license please contact your Xilinx sales contact.


### Step 1. Build Versal Extensible Embedded Platform Example Design in Vivado

1. Launch Vivado IDE and select ***Open Example Project*** from the Welcome window. You can also do it by clicking ***File*** from the menu and select ***Project*** and then ***Open Example***.

2. Click ***Next*** to skip the first page of the wizard. In the template selection page, select the ***Versal Extensible Embedded Platform*** template. Click ***Next***.

3. Name this project as ***custom_pfm_vck190*** and click ***Next***.

4. In the board selection page, select ***VCK190 ES1 Evaluation Platform***. If you are going to target other platform, you may select others. Click ***Next***.

5. In the design preset page, make the following changes:

6. Click ***Finish*** to complete the example design creation phase and this will open up the Vivado project with the template design you just created.
You can open the block design to view the details of the platform design.
By using the pre-built template, you can easily get a validated hardware design of the platform to move on to the next step. In your real design development procedure, you may use this as a baseline design and make further modifications on top of it.

7. Click ***Generate Block Design*** from the Flow Navigator panel on the left and select ***Global*** as the synthesis option. Click ***Generate*** and wait for the process to complete.

8. Click ***File*** from the menu and select ***Export Platform***.

   a. On the first page, select ***Hardware*** as the platform type (this tutorial runs on hardware).

   b. On the second page select ***Pre-synthesis***.

   c. On the third page, add the name of the platform.

      ![missing image](images/export_xsa_updated.PNG)
      Here we name the board as "xd" because of software limitation.

   d. On the fourth page, set the name of the XSA.

9. Close the Vivado project after platform export process finishes.



### Step 2. Build the Platform in the Vitis Software Platform

1. Open the Vitis IDE and select a workspace.

2. On the Welcome Page, select ***Create Platform Project*** or select ***File → New →  Platform Project ...***.

3. Set the platform project name to ***base_pfm_vck190*** and click ***Next***.

      ![missing image](images/211_create_platform_pg1.png)

4. Use the XSA generated in the previous step and set the Operating System to  ***aie_runtime*** and the Processor to ***ai_engine***. Click ***Finish*** to create the platform project.

      ![missing image](images/create_platform_pg2.png)

5. Then build the platform by clicking on the hammer icon.

      ![missing image](images/build_platform.png)
>**Note**: If you modify the XSA file later, first right-click the platform project and select ***Update Hardware Specification*** and then rebuild the platform project.

6. The generated platform can be found in `base_pfm_vck190/export`.

In this step, you created the platform starting with building the hardware platform in the Vivado Design Suite. Then you built the platform in the Vitis software platform, based on the exported XSA file.

In the next step, you will build an AI Engine application using this platform.
