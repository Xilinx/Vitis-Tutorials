## AI Engine Debug with Integrated Logic Analyzer (ILA)

Adding ChipScope helps debugging AIE PL interfaces in the design running on hardware including checking for AXI protocol violations, hardware kernel issues, data integrity, and performance issues of the design. 
To debug using ILAs, the design is required to enable ILA in hardware build.

## Enable ILA in design

This tutorial uses v++ --debug option to enable ILA IP core insertion to the design.
Syntax:
```
--debug.chipscope <cu_name>[:<interface_name>]
```
Example:
```
v++ -g -l --platform ${PLATFORM} ${XOS} ${LIBADF} \
       --debug.chipscope s2mm_v4_1:s0 \
       --debug.chipscope mm2s_v4_1:s0 \
       -t ${TARGET} ${VPP_FLAGS} -o $@
```
**Note:** v++ allows multiple `--debug.chipscope` lines to meet design debug needs.


### Step 1. Prepare the ILA enabled Makefile.
Use the provided `Makefile.ILA` from this tutorial's root directory. Rename `Makefile.ILA` to `Makefile`.
```bash
cd ${DOWNLOAD_PATH}/AI_Engine_Development/Feature_Tutorials/09-debug-walkthrough
cp Makefile.ILA Makefile
```

### Step 2. Build the ILA enabled design
```bash
make clean; make
```
After the design is built. Inspect the ILA insertion with `mm2s_v4_1:s0` and `s2mm_v4_1:s0` interfaces.

### Step 3. Boot up the design
Flash the SD card with the ILA enabled design, plug in the flashed SD card to VCK190 sd card slot and boot up the board.


## Setup the connection with Vivado
### Step 4. Setup Connection to the Hardware Board
#### Step 4.1. Target Connection Setup
Run hardware server from computer that connects to target board. To do so, launch hw_server from the computer that has JTAG connection to the VCK190 board.

#### Step 4.2. Launch Vivado
Launch Vivadoâ„¢ from where the to be debugged project is by issue command, `vivado`.  

#### Step 4.3. Setup Vivado Hardware Manager
After Vivado is up, click on highlighted icon.

#### Step 4.4. Setup Hardware Target

#### Step 4.5. Input Hardware Target
Enter hardware server's IP address or hostname to highlighted area and click **Next**.

#### Step 4.6. Check Hardware Target
Confirm target's information from JTAG chain then click **Next**.

#### Step 4.7. Select probe file
Click the ellipsis (**...**) to select the generated probe file, `${PROJECT_PATH}/bf_hw.ltx` or `${PROJECT_PATH}/_x/link/int/bf_hw.ltx` from this design.

#### Step 4.8. Select ILA to be examined.
Click on `hw_ila_1` to examine the design.

#### Step 4.9. Setup design's signals to be debugged
Click on `+` to configure the desired signals and their values during run time.

Example below selects TVALID signal from `mm2s_v4_1_s0` and `vitis_design_s2mm_v4_1_0_so` interfaces that capture valid transfers are driven from master. Set value to `B (both transition` so transitions of valid data signals can be captured.

#### Step 4.10. Enable ILA to capture the configured signals to debug
Click one of highlighted icons to capture configured signals.

Wait for ILA is ready to capture signals, run the application from vck190 board.

#### Step 4.11. Expected result
<img src="images/il_run_done.png" width="900">

After completing above steps, we are able to see the captured, related AXI signals and data are shown in waveform with timing information from Vivado.

#### Step 5. Examine captured results
<img src="images/il_run_result.png" width="900">

Expand `slot_0:mm2s_v4_1_s0:Interface` and `slot_1:vitis_design_s2mm_v4_1_0_s0:Interface` by click on `>` icon.
Review the above captured result. `mm2s_v4_1_s0:TVALID` shows '1' which indicates a valid data is available at the time marker pointed.
Moving time marker across time line, changes of AIX protocol values indicate values changed at what time shown below. For example at clock cycle 4, `TVALID` is 1 where `TDATA` is `57f8a5855ea25c52`. This is how to determine when and what a valid data is sent/received.
