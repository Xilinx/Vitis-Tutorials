# Phase 1: Create a Fixed Platform from an AI Engine Application and PL Kernels

1. Launch the **Vitis IDE** on a new workspace, `Phase1Wkspc`:

   ![Vitis IDE Launcher](./Images/Image001.png)

2. Because this is a new workspace, add a new platform (the VCK190) within the list of available platforms. Click **Xilinx → Add Custom Platform**. Click **+** and navigate to your **Platforms** repository. Select the **xilinx_vck190_base_202120_1** directory and click **Open**.

   ![Add New Platform](./Images/Image002.png)

3. Click **OK**. The design that will be used for the purposes of this tutorial is shown in the following block diagram:

   ![Application Block Diagram](./Images/Image003.png)

   The AI Engine graph itself is composed of four central kernels:

   * **Weighted sum**: This is a simple filter using the following taps: [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 ].
   * **Average**: Division by 36, which is the sum of the taps.
   * **PolarClip**: Clips the modulus of the data (complex data).
   * **Classifier**: The output of this kernel is the quadrant of the input complex number.

   All of these kernels are instantiated within the AI Engine array except PolarClip, which is an HLS kernel that will be instantiated in the PL.

   Two more PL kernels that do not belong to the graph are used to get data from the DDR to the AI Engine array and vice versa from the AI Engine array to the PL: **MM2S** and **S2MM**.

   Now create the project, starting with the AI Engine sub-project.

4. From the menu bar, select **File → New → Application Project**. In the platform selection GUI, select the **xilinx_vck190_base_202120_1 [custom]**. On the next screen, specify **CoSim1_AIE** as the Application Project Name and **CoSim1_system** as the System Project Name. Ensure that the selected Processor is **ai_engine**.

   ![Application Project Details](./Images/Image004.png)

5. Select **Empty Application** in the template selection screen.

6. You must also include a hardware kernel project for the programmable logic part. Right-click **Cosim1_system** and select **Add Hw Kernel Project...**. Specify **CoSim1_PL** as the Hw Kernel Project Name.

You should now have the following project structure in the Explorer view:

![Project Structure](./Images/Image005.png)

7. Import the source code for the AI Engine sub-project. Right-click **CoSim1_AIE [aiengine]** and select **Import Sources...**. Browse to **Files** and select **AIE**. On the following screen, check **AIE** and remove the trailing **/src** from the "Into folder:" edit area.

   ![AIE Import Sources](./Images/Image006.png)

8. Reiterate the same operations for the **CoSim1_PL** sub-project and selecting the directory **PL** in the Files directory.

   The `src` and `data` folders should be populated in the AI Engine sub-project, as well as the `src` folder in the programmable logic sub-project:

   ![Populated sub-directories](./Images/Image007.png)

9. Set some parameters of the AI Engine sub-project. Right-click **CoSim1_AIE [aiengine]** and select **C/C++ Build Settings**. In the Input Spec pane, add an **include** path to enable access to the PL source code, `polar_clip.cpp`. Click the **+** on the Include Paths upper window, then click the **Workspace** button and select **Cosim1_PL/src**.

10. In the Top-Level Files sub-window, click **+**, then click **Workspace** and select **Cosim1_AIE/src/graph.cpp**.

   ![C/C++ Settings](./Images/Image008.png)

   You can now compile the AI Engine project for Emulation-AIE active build configuration.
   
11. Right-click **CoSim1_AIE** and select **Build Project...**.

12. During compile, take a look in the file `graph.h`. You can see that the `weightsum` kernel is associated with the function `vectorize_weighted_cpx_sum_with_margin` that can be found in the file `src/aie_kernels/weighted_sum.cc`.

13. When the compilation has finished, you can visualize the result by double-clicking **Cosim1_system / CoSim1_AIE / Emulation-AIE / Compile Summary (graph)** in the Assistant view of the IDE. Vitis Analyzer is launched and you can visualize the graph and the array placement:

   ![Vitis Analyzer](./Images/Image009.png)

   The kernels are grouped in the 24th and 25th columns of the array. The communication with the the kernel `polar_clip`, as well as the input data and the output data transfers, also occur in columns 24 and 25 of the array.

14. Open the project file **Cosim1_PL/Cosim1_PL.prj**. Click the lightning icon to select all the PL kernels:

   ![Add PL Kernels](./Images/Image010.png)

15. Select **mm2s**, **polar_clip**, and **s2mm**, then click **OK**.

16. Specify that the kernel `polar_clip` is referenced in the AI Engine graph by checking the related box:

   ![PL Kernel in AI Engine Graph](./Images/Image011.png)

   Compile the PL kernels by right-clicking on **Cosim1_PL** and selecting **Build Project**.

   When the compilation is finished, link the AI Engine domain with the programmable logic domain. This can be done in the sub-project, `Cosim1_system_hw_link`, that was automatically created at the beginning of this tutorial. You have to define how you want the various parts of the design to be connected together. This is the purpose of the configuration file that you will now import. This file also contains advanced parameters to create the following:

      - An `sd_card` directory, which is of interest for the hardware implementation flow
      - A Xilinx support archive (XSA) file, which is the base for the fixed platform creation in phase 2.

17. Right-click **Cosim1_system_hw_link** and select **Import Sources...**. Browse to **PostLinkRecompile / Files / HwLink** and click **Open**. Check **system.cfg**. For the "Into folder:" edit area, click **Browse** and select **Cosim1_system_hw_link [pl]**.

18. In Explorer view, click **Cosim1_system_hw_link [pl] / Cosim1_system_hw_link.prj** to open the project file. There is one container named `binary_container_1`, populated with the two kernels `mm2s` and `s2mm`.

19. Click **binary_container_1** to change the name to **cosim_container**. Right-click **cosim_container** and select **Edit v++ options**. Specify the Vitis compiler options: **--config ../system.cfg**.

20. Right-click **Cosim1_system_hw_link [pl]** and select **Build Project**.

   The outcome of this link stage contains two major files:
   * `cosim_container.xclbin`
   * `cosim_container.xsa`, the hardware platform specification

   ![Outcome of link stage](./Images/Image012.png)

21. Double-click **cosim_container.xsa** to display the hardware platform specification. This is the address map for all IPs in the hardware platform.

22. Double-click **cosim_container.xclbin.link_summary** to launch Vitis Analyzer. From here, you can visualize the system and platform diagram.


# Phase 2: Use a Platform generated by V++ and modify the AI Engine Application

The purpose of phase 2 of this tutorial is to start from the generated hardware platform and modify the AI Engine application. To start the second phase, close the Vitis software platform and then start it again using another workspace, **Phase2Wkspc**.

![Start Vitis with new Worksapce](./Images/Image013.png)

1. Create a new application project by clicking **File → New → Application Project**. In the Platform Selection screen, click **Create a new platform from hardware (XSA)**. To find the XSA file, browse to the XSA file that you generated in the previous stage: **CoSim1_system_hw_link / Emulation-HW / cosim_container.xsa**. Give it a new name: **PostLinkPlatform**.

![Fixed Platform Selection](./Images/Image014.png)

2. Click **Next** to go back to the application project creation:

   * Application project name: **Cosim2_AIE**
   * System project name: **Cosim2_system**
   * Processor: **aiengine**

![New AI Engine project](./Images/Image015.png)

   In the Explorer view, you can see two projects have been created:

   * **CoSim2_system** with the sub-project **Cosim2_AIE**
   * **PostLinkPlatform**

3. Update the AI Engine project. Import the source files in the directory `AIE2`. Right-click **Cosim2_AIE** and select **Import Sources...**. Browse to **PostLinkRecompile / Files / AIE2**. On the next screen check **AIE2** and remove the trailing **/src** from the "Into folder:" edit area. There are two modifications in the file `graph.h`:

   * The kernel `weightsum` is now replaced by a scalar version (not using the vector processor), `weighted_cpx_sum_with_margin`.
   * This same kernel is now constrained to be placed in the AI Engine tile column 5 row 5.

4. Right-click **Cosim2_system → Cosim2_AIE** and select **C/C++ Build Settings**. In the Top-Level Files window, click **+**, click **Workspace**, and select **Cosim2_AIE / src / graph.cpp**. Click **Apply and Close**.

You can now build the AI Engine project. It will start by compiling the standalone domain of the PostLinkPlatform platform and continue with the AI Engine project.

5. After the compilation is finished, double-click **Cosim2_system / Cosim2_AIE / Emulation-AIE / Work / graph.aiecompile_summary**. Vitis Analyzer is launched. Display the **Graph** and the **Array**:

   ![Graph and Array View](./Images/Image016.png)

   On the left, you can see the effect of the constraint on the placement of the kernel `weightsum`. On the right, you can see the constraint implied by the platform itself:

   ![Connections to _weightsum_ and _average_](./Images/Image017.png)

   The kernel `weightsum` has been constrained to be placed in the tile (5,5). The next AI Engine kernel, `average`, has been placed just beside it, in tile (6,4). In the previous phase, you saw that all the connections with the PL occurred within column 24 and 25. In this phase, these connections' locations have been turned into a constraint. This is why you see long routes to connect the predefined PLIOs with the new location of the `weightsum` kernel.

   The ultimate goal of this phase is the hardware emulation of the global system (AI Engine array, PL, PS). The Xilinx Runtime library (XRT) is a key component of the Vitis software platform that enables developers to deploy on Xilinx adaptable platforms, especially Versal ACAPs. The PS application in this tutorial is based on XRT.

6. Start by creating an XRT domain. Double-click **PostLinkPlatform / platform.spr**. In the PostLinkPlatform project GUI, right-click **PostLinkPlatform** and select **Add Domain**. Enter the following parameters:

| Option | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| Name   | xrt  |
| OS   | linux  |
| Bif File   |  /**Your_Local_Install**/platforms/xilinx_vck190_base_202120_1/sw/xilinx_vck190_base_202120_1/boot/linux.bif |
| Boot Components Directory  |  /**Your_Local_Install**/platforms/xilinx_vck190_base_202120_1/sw/xilinx_vck190_base_202120_1/boot |
|Linux Image Directory   |  /**Your_Local_Install**/platforms/xilinx_vck190_base_202120_1/sw/xilinx_vck190_base_202120_1/xrt/image |

![New Domain XRT](./Images/Image018.png)

7. The XRT domain parameters are filled up automatically, but the Linux RootFS, sysroot directory, and all the QEMU parameters still need to be updated if they are not correctly specified:

| Option | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| Linux Rootfs   |  /**Your_Local_Install**/common/xilinx-versal-common-v2021.2/rootfs.ext4 |
| Sysroot Directory   |  /**Your_Local_Install**/petalinux/2021.2/sysroots/aarch64-xilinx-linux |
| QEMU Data   |  /**Your_Local_Install**/platforms/xilinx_vck190_base_202120_1/sw/xilinx_vck190_base_202120_1/qemu |
| QEMU Arguments   | /**Your_Local_Install**/platforms/xilinx_vck190_base_202120_1/sw/xilinx_vck190_base_202120_1/qemu/qemu_args.txt  |
| PMC QEMU Arguments   | /**Your_Local_Install**/platforms/xilinx_vck190_base_202120_1/sw/xilinx_vck190_base_202120_1/qemu/pmc_args.txt  |

![Finalizing XRT](./Images/Image019.png)

8. In Explorer view, right-click **PostLinkPlatform** and select **Build project**.

9. Create a new application. Right-click **CoSim2_system** and select **Add Application project...**. Provide the application project name: **Cosim2_PS**. By default, it is associated to the processor `psv_cortexa72_SMP`, which contains the `xrt` domain. On the next screen, specify the kernel image.

| Option | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| Kernel Image   |  /**Your_Local_Install**/common/xilinx-versal-common-v2021.2/Image |

10. Select the **Empty Application** template to finish the application project creation. After this step, there is nothing required other than the standard operations to perform hardware emulation.

11. Import the sources. Right-click **CoSim2_PS** and select **Import Sources**. Navigate to **PostLinkrecompile / Files / PS**. Check **PS**, remove the trailing **/src** in the "Into folder:" edit area, and click **Finish**.

12. There is another file to import, which has been automatically generated by the AI Engine compiler: `Cosim2_AIE/Emulation-AIE/Work/ps/c_rts/aie_control_xrt.cc`. It contains basic definitions related to the graph that are required during hardware emulation and hardware implementation. Copy it over to the directory `Cosim2_PS/src`.

13. Right-click **Cosim2_PS** and select **C/C++ Settings**.

14. In GCC Host Compiler(...), select **Dialect**. For the language standard, select **ISO C++ly(-stdc++1y)**.

15. In Includes, two paths need to be added:

   * `${workspace_loc:/Cosim2_AIE/src}`
   * `${env_var:XILINX_VITIS}/aietools/include`

16. Finally, in the GCC Host Linker (...), select **Libraries**. In the library search path, add the following two paths:

   * `${env_var:XILINX_VITIS}/aietools/lib/aarch64.o`
   * `${env_var:XILINX_VITIS}/aietools/lib/lnx64.o`

17. In Libraries, add the following two libraries:

   * `adf_api_xrt`
   * `xrt_coreutil`

18. Click **Apply and Close** to finish the settings. Build the PS application **CoSim2_PS**.

19. Open the **Cosim2_system** project file and fill in the packaging option: `PostLinkRecompile/Phase1Wkspc/CoSim1_system_hw_link/Emulation-HW/cosim_container.xclbin`. Build the system project **CoSim2_system**.

20. Run the `hw_emu` simulation. Right-click **CoSim2_system** and select **Run As → Run Configurations**. Double-click **System Project Debug** to create a new run configuration. Click the **Edit...** button beside the Program Arguments. The argument is the name of the XCLBIN file: **cosim_container.xclbin**. Uncheck the **Automatically update arguments** option at the bottom of the window.

21. Click **Apply** and **Run**, then click **Start Emulator and Run**. The simulation runs to the end, specifying at `(Step 8)` (~2 minutes) that the simulation has passed.

# Hardware Implementation

1. Replicate exactly the same flow for hardware implementation, changing the system target to **Hardware** to run the design on your VCK190 board. Select one of the following base platforms depending on your board:

- `xilinx_vck190_base_202120_1`
- `xilinx_vck190_es1_base_202120_1`

2. When the two phases are completed, there will be a `sd_card.img` file in the `Hardware` directory. Use a standard SD card imager with this file to initialize an SD card.

3. Place the SD card in the top SD card slot of your board.

4. Open a serial terminal connected to the right COM port of your VCK190 and switch on your board.

5. The system boots. When this is finished, change the directory before launching the PS application.

```
cd /mnt/sd-mmcblk0p1
source ./init.sh
./CoSim2.exe cosim_container.xclbin
```
