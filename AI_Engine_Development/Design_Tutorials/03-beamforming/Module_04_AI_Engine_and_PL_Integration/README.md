# Recap

In _Module 01 - Creating a Custom Platform_, you created your custom embedded platform with the base components (CIPS, AI Engine, NoC, clocking infrastructure, and boot software) to create an AI Engine design that is stitched together.

In _Module 02 - Creating an AI Engine Application_, you introduced the beamforming kernel and created your downlink and uplink subgraphs, the data flow specification graph, and your top-level AI Engine application.

In _Module 03 - Creating the PL Kernels_, you solved the data storage problem by creating PL kernels to send reference input data to the AI Engine and store output data generated by the AI Engine.

In this module, you stitch together the custom platform (``.xpfm``), the AI Engine graph (``.o``), and the PL kernels (``.xo``) into an XSA file with the Vitis™ compiler (``v++``) linker step.  

## Building the Design

The Vitis compiler linker step for this large design takes ~16 hours to complete.

### Build XSA from Scratch

Building the XSAs from scratch takes about 16 hours to complete. To create the Vitis compiler linker output from scratch, start the builds with the following commands:

```bash
make xsa_all
```
or
```
make xsa TARGET=hw REV=rev0          #fails timing
make xsa TARGET=hw REV=rev1          #passes timing
make xsa TARGET=hw_emu REV=rev1      #create for hardware emulation
```
or
```bash
mkdir build/rev0/hw
cd build/rev0/hw
v++ -l                                                  \

### Build Products

Notice that the Vitis compiler linker step was invoked three times producing the following build directories:

|FileName|Description|
|  ---  |  ---  |
|build/rev0/hw/|Vitis compiler linker build with a naive implementation that fails timing. |
|build/rev1/hw/|Vitis compiler linker build with timing closure strategies applied that meets timing. |
|build/rev1/hw_emu/|Vitis compiler linker build that meets timing for hardware emulation run.|

The rev0 build contains the first revision of the Vitis compiler linker step that naively links the AI Engine graph design to the PL kernels and PL platform. However, because the beamforming design makes full use of PL resources, the straightforward implementation does not meet timing. The rev1 build is the second revision of the Vitis compiler linker step with timing closure techniques applied. In Module 06, you will be working through hardware emulation, and you will need to invoke the Vitis compiler linker step again with rev1 and TARGET=hw_emu.

## Introduction: Linking the System

After the AI Engine graph is created and the RTL kernels are packaged, the `v++ --link` command links them with the target platform to build the device binary (XSA). This XSA is used to program the hardware and includes the PDI, debug data, memory topology, IP layout, and metadata.

## Timing Failure

The straightforward invocation of the Vitis compiler linker step (rev0) fails to meet timing. Open the timing summary reports from rev0 and rev1 and compare them.

If you built from scratch, the timing summary reports are in the following locations:

```
build/rev0/hw/_x/link/vivado/vpl/prj/prj.runs/impl_1/vck190_v1_0_wrapper_timing_summary_routed.rpt
build/rev1/hw/_x/link/vivado/vpl/prj/prj.runs/impl_1/vck190_v1_0_wrapper_timing_summary_routed.rpt
```

### REV0: vck190_v1_0_wrapper_timing_summary_routed.rpt

Scroll down to the Design Timing Summary section in the timing summary report. You will see that rev0 has a negative Worst Negative Slack (WNS) and a negative Total Negative Slack (TNS). This indicates that the design has failed timing.    

```

The rev0 build has a negative slack and fails timing while the rev1 build does not. During the Vitis compiler linker step, the rev0 and rev1 builds used different configuration files. A configuration file is used to specify more Vitis compiler options. The rev0 build used the ``config.ini`` file with no timing closure technique options. The rev1 build used the ``config_2regslice.ini`` file which is similar to the ``config.ini`` but contains additional timing closure techniques. Both the ``*.ini`` files are located in `Module_04_AI_Engine_and_PL_Integration/` folder. The next sections detail the ``config.ini`` file for the rev0 build, and then the changes made in the ``config_2regslice.ini`` for a successful rev1 build which meets timing.  

## REV0 Configuration File (config.ini)

The Vitis compiler requires three sections in the configuration file (``config.ini``): `[connectivity]`, `[clock]`, and `[advanced]`. Open the `config.ini` file, review the comments, and follow the notes in the next sections of this module.

### \[connectivity\] Section

The ``[connectivity]`` section includes the `nk` and `sc` switches.

#### Number of Kernels

The ``nk`` switch specifies the number of kernel instances or compute units (CUs) the ``v++`` command adds to the device binary (XSA). It specifies the kernel name, the number of instances (or CUs) of that kernel, and the CU name for each instance. For example, the first set of kernel instances is as follows:


```
#PL Kernel Instances for Downlink Subgraph 0
nk=dlbf_data:1:dlbf_data_00
nk=dlbf_coeffs:8:dlbf_coeffs_00.dlbf_coeffs_01.dlbf_coeffs_02.dlbf_coeffs_03.dlbf_coeffs_04.dlbf_coeffs_05.dlbf_coeffs_06.dlbf_coeffs_07
nk=dlbf_slave:8:dlbf_o00.dlbf_o01.dlbf_o02.dlbf_o03.dlbf_o04.dlbf_o05.dlbf_o06.dlbf_o07
```

The first line specifies there is one `dlbf_data` PL kernel named `dlbf_data_00`. The second line specifies there are eight `dlbf_coeffs` PL kernels named `dlbf_coeffs_00 ... dlbf_coeffs_07`. The last line specifies that there are eight `dlbf_slave` PL kernels named `dlbf_o00 ... dlbd_o07`. The ``config.ini`` file repeats this three times because there are three instances of the downlink subgraph.

The config.ini file also repeats this connection scheme for the ULBF PL kernels:

```
#PL Kernel Instances for Uplink Subgraph 0
nk=ulbf_data:1:ulbf_data_00
nk=ulbf_coeffs:4:ulbf_coeffs_00.ulbf_coeffs_01.ulbf_coeffs_02.ulbf_coeffs_03
nk=ulbf_slave:4:ulbf_o00.ulbf_o01.ulbf_o02.ulbf_o03
```
The ``config.ini`` file repeats this three times because there are three instances of the uplink subgraph. Each uplink subgraph requires one ``ulbf_data`` kernel, four ``ulbf_coeff`` kernels, and four ``ulbf_slave`` kernels.

#### Streaming Connections

The `sc` switch defines connections between the ports of the AI Engine graph and the streaming ports of PL kernels. The first set of `sc` connections are between the `dlbf_data` PL kernel instances and the AI Engine `dlbfid` (input data) ports. The next set of connections are between the `dlbf_coeffs` PL kernels and the AI Engine `dlbfic` (input coefficient) ports. The AI Engine ports are connected to the PL kernels’ `M00_AXIS` (master AXI4-Stream) ports.

The next connections are between the AI Engine `dlbfo` (output) ports and the `dlbf_slave` instances. The AI Engine ports are connected to the PL kernels’ `S_AXIS` (slave AXI4-Stream) ports.

The `config.ini` file repeats this connection scheme for all three instances of the DLBF system and for all three ULBF systems as well.

### \[clock\] Section

The next section of the `config.ini` is the `[clock]` section. It only uses two clocks (`id=0` and `id=3`). The clock `id=0` is a 100 MHz clock. Clock `id=3` is a 400 MHz clock. These clocks were created by the clocking wizard in the custom platform (_Module 01 - Creating a Custom Platform_). They are available for the Vitis compiler linker to use in this step. This is possible because they were exposed using the `PFM.clock` function when creating the custom platform (XPFM).

All of the PL kernels’ `s_axi_aclk` are connected to the 100 MHz clock (`id=0`). This clock is for the AXI4-Lite port of the PL kernels. It clocks the control path in the PL kernels which allows the CIPS to send/receive control and status signals from the PL kernels. The `dlbf_data`, `ulbf_data`, `dlbf_coeff`, and `ulbf_coeff` PL kernels have an `m_axis_clk`. The `dlbf_slave` and `ulbf_slave` PL kernels have an `s_axis_clk`. These clocks are connected to the 400 MHz clock (`id=3`). This clock is for the AXI4-Stream port on these PL kernels. It clocks the data path in the PL kernels which allows the AI Engine to receive or send data to/from the PL kernels.

### \[advanced\] Section

* **`param=compiler.addOutputTypes=hw_export`:** This switch specifies the creation of a new XSA for the target platform. The exported XSA has the name of the output file specified by the `-o` option in the (``v++``) command, with the extension `.xsa`. This advanced option should only be set when creating a new XSA. This option is required for building the fixed platform in the bare-metal flow.
* **`param=hw_emu.enableProfiling=false`:** This switch sets the hardware emulation profiling feature off.
* **`param=compiler.maxComputeUnits=1000`:** This switch sets the maximum number of compute units allowed in the system. Without this switch, the default number of maxComputeUnits is 60.  

### New XSA Platform: rev0

If you built from scratch, you can open the block design in the Vivado™ project to view the new hardware platform at `build/rev0/hw/_x/link/vivado/vpl/prj/prj.xpr`.

![Linked Hardware Platform](images/linker_vivado_block_diagram.png)

Notice the new XSA hardware platform built on top of the custom platform you built in Module 01 (Creating a Custom Platform). It still contains the original building blocks: CIPS, NoC, AI Engine, Clocking Wizard, Processor Reset Systems, ``ctrl_sm``, and 16 AXI4-Lite SmartConnect interfaces. However, you will also notice that only six of these are being used, and ten of them remain unused.

Each AXI4-Lite SmartConnect interface can have up to 15 AXI4-Lite master interfaces. Four of the AXI4-Lite SmartConnect interfaces have 15 AXI4-Lite master interfaces instantiated, one of them has 14, and one of them has four. This is total of 78 AXI4-Lite master interfaces which are connected to the newly linked PL kernels (three ``dlbf_data``, 24 ``dlbf_coeff``, three ``ulbf_data``, 12 ``ulbf_coeff``, 24 ``dlbf_slave``, and 12 ``ulbf_slave`` kernels). The AI Engine is also connected to all the PL kernels through their AXI4-Stream interfaces.

## Timing Closure
We know that the straightforward configuration file for the Vitis compiler linker did not meet timing. This was because this design is a high resource utilization design, running at a high frequency clock rate (400 MHz). The Vivado tool cannot perform timing closure without user intervention. This is solved by adding two ``axi4s-register slice`` IPs between the PL kernels and the AI Engine, updating the connections in the configuration file, and applying timing closure strategies during placement and routing.

### Timing Closure Strategy

There are many different ways to close timing. This section details how timing closure been approached in the beamforming design.

First, find the problematic paths that resulted in the negative slack. The longest paths in the design are between the PL kernels and AI Engine, which cannot operate at 400 MHz clock frequency without negative slack.

The first thing to do is try to break up these paths and reduce the amount of time it takes to get from the PL kernel to the AI Engine. This was done by introducing two AXI register slice IPs in the paths to pipeline the data flow.

In addition to adding the AXI register slices, we also explored timing closure strategies that could be applied during each stage of implementation: placement, routing, and physical optimization. The full list of strategies available for each stage is documented in _Vivado Design Suite User Guide Implementation Chapter 2: Implementing the Design_ ([UG904](https://www.xilinx.com/search/support-keyword-search.html#q=ug904)).

## REV1: Configuration File (config_2regslice.ini)

The next step is to review the configuration file that contains the timing closure strategy that created rev1, which did meet timing. Open the `config_2regslice.ini` file, review the comments, and follow the next sections of this module.

### \[connectivity\] Section

An additional ``nk`` switch is added, which creates 528 ``axi4s_regslice`` PL kernels. In Module 03, you compiled the XO for the ``axi4s_regslice`` PL kernel definition.  

```
nk=axi4s_regslice_64b:528
```
The ``sc`` switches are also altered so that there are two ``axi4s_regslice_64b`` kernels between the PL kernels and AI Engine. The following snippet is an example of how this is done.

```
sc=dlbf_data_00.M00_AXIS:axi4s_regslice_64b_1.S_AXIS
sc=axi4s_regslice_64b_1.M_AXIS:axi4s_regslice_64b_2.S_AXIS
sc=axi4s_regslice_64b_2.M_AXIS:ai_engine_0.dlbfid0
```

### \[clock\] Section

All the ``axi4s_regslice-64b`` kernels are clocked by id=3 (400 MHz).

### \[vivado\] Section

At the end of the ``config_2regslice.ini`` file, you will notice there are additional Vivado options given to the Vitis compiler linker.  

`prop=run.impl_1.STEPS.ROUTE_DESIGN.ARGS.MORE OPTIONS=-tns_cleanup`

`param=project.writeIntermediateCheckpoints=1`

`prop=run.impl_1.STEPS.PLACE_DESIGN.ARGS.DIRECTIVE=ExtraNetDelay_high`

`prop=run.impl_1.STEPS.PHYS_OPT_DESIGN.ARGS.DIRECTIVE=AggressiveExplore`

`prop=run.impl_1.STEPS.ROUTE_DESIGN.ARGS.DIRECTIVE=AggressiveExplore`

These are the combination timing closure strategies applied during placement, route, and physical optimization that resulted in timing closure.

### New XSA Platform: rev1

If you built from scratch, you can open the block design in the Vivado project to view the new hardware platform at `build/rev1/hw/_x/link/vivado/vpl/prj/prj.xpr`. Notice how the ``axi4s_regslice_64b`` PL kernels are inserted between the AI Engine and original PL kernels.
