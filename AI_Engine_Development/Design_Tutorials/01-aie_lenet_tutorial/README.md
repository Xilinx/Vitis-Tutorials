# Introduction
The Xilinx® Versal ACAP is a fully software-programmable, heterogeneous compute platform that combines the Processor System (PS) (Scalar Engines that include the Arm® processors), Programmable Logic (PL) (Adaptable Engines that include the programmable logic blocks and memory) and AI Engines which belong in the Intelligent Engine category.

This tutorial uses the LeNet algorithm to implement a system-level design to perform image classification using the AI Engine and PL logic, including block RAM (BRAM). The design demonstrates functional partitioning between the AI Engine and PL. It also highlights memory partitioning and hierarchy among DDR memory, PL (BRAM) and AI Engine memory.

The tutorial takes you through hardware emulation and hardware flow in the context of a complete Versal ACAP system integration. A Makefile is provided that you can modify to suit your own needs in a different context.

## Objectives
After completing the tutorial, you should be able to:
* Build a complete system design by going through the various steps in the Vitis™ unified software platform flow, including creating the AI Engine Adaptive Data Flow API (ADF) graph, compiling the A72 host application and compiling PL kernels, using the Vitis compiler (V++) to link the AI Engine and HLS kernels with the platform, and packaging the design. You will also be able to run the design through the hardware emulation and hardware flow in a mixed System C/RTL cycle-accurate/QEMU-based simulator
* Develop an understanding of CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) layer details using the LeNet algorithm and how the layers are mapped into data processing and compute blocks

## Tutorial Overview
In this application tutorial, the LeNet algorithm is used to perform image classification on an input image using five AI Engine tiles and PL resources including block RAM. A top level block diagram is shown in the following figure. An image is loaded from DDR memory through the NoC to block RAM and then to the AI Engine. The PL input pre-processing unit receives the input image and sends the output to the first AI Engine tile to perform matrix multiplication. The output from the first AI Engine tile goes to a PL unit to perform the first level of maxpool and data rearrangement (M1R1). The output is fed to the second AI Engine tile and the output from that tile is sent to the PL to perform the second level maxpooling and data rearrangement (M2R2). The output is then sent to a fully connected layer (FC1) implemented in two AI Engine tiles and uses the rectified linear unit layer (ReLu) as an activation function. The outputs from the two AI Engine tiles are then fed into a second fully connected layer implemented in the fifth AI Engine tile. The output is sent to a data conversion unit in the PL and then to the DDR memory through the NoC. In between the AI Engine and PL units is a datamover module (refer to the Lenet Controller in the figure below) that contains the following kernels:
* `mm2s`: a Memory Mapped to Stream kernel to feed data from DDR memory through the NoC to the AI Engine Array
* `s2mm`: a Stream to Memory Mapped kernel to feed data from the AI Engine Array through NoC to DDR memory

![Image of LeNet Block Diagram](images/Lenet_block_diagram_v1.PNG)

In the design, there are two major PL kernels. The input pre-processing unit, M1R1 and M2R2 are contained in the `lenet_kernel` RTL kernel which has already been packaged as a Xilinx object `.xo` (XO) file. The datamover kernel `dma_hls` provides the interface between the AI Engine and DDR memory. The five AI Engine kernels all implement matrix multiplication. The matrix dimensions depend on the image dimension, weight dimension, and number of features.

# Building the LeNet Design

<details>
  <summary>LeNet Design Build</summary> 
	
## LeNet Design Build
In this section, you will build and run the LeNet design. You will compile the AI Engine design and integrate it into a larger system design (including the Programmable Logic (PL) kernels and Processing System (PS) host application). You can review [Integrating the Application Section in the AI Engine Documentation](#ai-engine-documentation) for the general flow. The following image shows the Vitis tool flow with the `make` targets (in blue) and input source files and output file generation (in red) at each step. 

![Image of LeNet Vitis Tool Flow](images/Lenet_vitis_toolflow_2020_2.PNG)

At the end of this section, the design flow will generate a new directory (called `build/`) that contains the `Work/`, `hw_emu/`, and `hw/` subfolders. The `Work/` subfolder is an output from the AI Engine compiler. The `hw_emu/` subfolder contains the build for hardware emulation. The `hw/` subfolder contains the build for hardware run on a VCK190 board.   

</details>

# Make Steps 
To run the following `make` steps (e.g. `make kernels`, `make graph`, etc), you must be in the `Makefiles/` folder.
```bash
cd Makefiles
```
<details>
<summary>Build the Entire Design with a Single Command</summary>
	
## Build the Entire Design with a Single Command
If you are an advanced user and are already familiar with the AI Engine and Vitis kernel compilation flows, you can build the entire design with one command: 

```bash
make build TARGET=hw_emu 
```
or 
```bash
make build TARGET=hw
```

This command will run the `make kernels` `make graph` `make xclbin` `make application` and `make package` for hardware emulation or to run on hardware (VCK190 board) depending on the `TARGET` you specify.

You can also run the following command to build the entire Lenet tutorial *and* launch hardware emulation: 
```bash
make run TARGET=hw_emu
```
</details>

<details>
  <summary>make kernels: Compile PL Kernels</summary> 
 
## make kernels: Compile PL Kernels
In this step, the Vitis compiler takes any V++ kernels (RTL or HLS C) in the PL region of the target platform (`xilinx_vck190_es1_base_202020_1`) and the AI Engine kernels and graph and compiles them into their respective XO files. In this design, the `dma_hls` kernel is compiled as an XO file and the `Lenet_kernel` has already been pre-compiled as an XO file. Users can access the source code by unzipping the .xo file

`unzip lenet_kernel.xo`

The files will be stored under `ip_repo` folder.

The following commands compiles the kernels (default TARGET=hw_emu). 

```
make kernels
```

The expanded command is as follow:
```
mkdir -p ../build/hw_emu

cd ../build/hw_emu

v++       --target hw_emu			     \
          --platform xilinx_vck190_es1_base_202020_1 \

  <summary>make graph: Creating the AI Engine ADF Graph for Vitis Compiler Flow</summary> 
 
## make graph: Creating the AI Engine ADF Graph for Vitis Compiler Flow
An ADF graph can be connected to an extensible Vitis platform (the graph I/Os can be connected either to platform ports or to ports on Vitis kernels through Vitis compiler connectivity directives. 
* The AI Engine ADF C++ graph of the design contains AI Engine kernels and PL kernels. 
* All interconnects between kernels are defined in the C++ graph
* All interconnections to external I/O are fully specified in the C++ simulation testbench (`graph.cpp`) that instantiates the C++ ADF graph object. All `adf::sim` platform connections from graph to PLIO map onto ports on the AI Engine subsystem graph that are connected using the Vitis compiler connectivity directives. No dangling ports or implicit connections are allowed by the Vitis compiler. 
 
To compile the graph using the Makefile flow type:
```
make graph
```
The following AI Engine compiler command compiles the AI Engine design graph: 
```
cd ../build;
aiecompiler --include= ../design/aie_src \	
	    --include= ../design/aie_src/data   \
            --verbose                    \

            --heapsize=2048              \
            --workdir=Work               \

  <summary>make xclbin: Use Vitis Tools to Link AI Engine and HLS Kernels with the Platform</summary> 
 
## make xclbin: Use Vitis Tools to Link AI Engine and HLS Kernels with the Platform
After the AI Engine kernels and graph and PL HLS kernels have been compiled, you can use the Vitis compiler to link them with the platform to generate both an XCLBIN and a new XSA file. 

## Platform
The Vitis tools allow you to integrate the AI Engine, HLS, and RTL kernels into an existing extensible platform. This is an automated step from a software developer perspective where the platform chosen is provided by the hardware designer (or you can opt to use one of the many extensible base platforms provided by Xilinx and the Vitis tools build the hardware design and integrate the AI Engine and PL kernels into the design.
 
To test this feature in this tutorial, use the base VCK190 platform to build the design.
 
The command to run this step is shown as follows (default TARGET=hw_emu):
```
make xclbin
``` 

The expanded command is as follow: 
```
cd ../build/hw_emu;

v++       -l                                                \
          --platform xilinx_vck190_es1_base_202020_1        \
          --save-temps                                      \
	  --temp_dir _x	                                    \
          --verbose                                         \
	  --g                                               \
          --config system.cfg                               \
	  -t hw_emu                                         \
          dma_hls.hw_emu.xo                                 \	  
          ../../design/pl_src/lenet_kernel/lenet_kernel.xo  \
          ../build/libadf.a                             \
          -o vck190_aie_lenet.hw_emu.xclbin   
	  
cd ../../Makefiles; 
 
```

The name of the AI Engine port is one that has been defined in `graph.cpp` PLIO instantiation.|
|param=compiler.addOutputTypes=hw_export| This option tells the Vitis compiler that besides creating an XCLBIN file, it also outputs an XSA file which is needed to create a post-Vivado fixed platform for Vitis software developement.|

Note that the Vitis compiler calls Vivado® IP integrator under the hood to build the design. The platform and kernels are input to the Vivado Design Suite, which produces a simulation XSA or an XSA after running place and route on the design. The point at which the XSA is produced from Vivado is dependent on what `-target` option is set on the the Vitis compiler command line. 

Note that you can now view the Vivado project, which is located in the `build/[hw|hw_emu]/\_x/link/vivado/vpl/prj` directory.

Now you have generated the XCLBIN file that will be used to execute your design on the platform.

## LeNet Architecture and AI Engine/PL Function Partitioning
The architecture of the LeNet design is show in the following figure. The details of the individual layers and their implementation will be described in a later section. This design provides an illustration of the functional partitioning between the AI Engine and PL resources, as shown in the block diagram previously. The input rearrange, maxpooling, and rearrange are scalar byte operations and interact with read/write memories to ensure sustained throughput. This set of operations are suitable to be implemented in PL rather than in the AI Engine array. With appropriate data rearrangement, the computation in the convolutional layers are presented as matrix multiplications and they are optimized to be implemented in the AI Engine array.

<details>
  <summary>Design Platform Details</summary>
	
## Design Platform Details
In the base platform, the CIPS, NoC and AI Engine are instantiated and interfaces among them are created. To add the various functions in a system level design, PL kernels are added to the base platform depending on the application developed, that is, the PL kernels present in each design might vary.  An ADF graph is connected to an extensible Vitis platform where the graph I/Os are connected either to the platform ports or to ports on Vitis kernels through the V++ connectivity directives.
For this design, the components are added by v++ -l step (make XCLBIN in the tool flow section above) and include the following:
* AI Engine kernel `graph.o`
* data mover kernel (`dma_hls.[hw|hw_emu].xo`)
* lenet kernel (`lenet_kernel.xo`)
* `ai_engine_system` block which includes the data width converter and clock converter kernels
* any other necessary connections and interfaces

To see a schematic view of the design with the extended platform (as shown in the following figure), open in the Vivado  `build/[hw|hw_emu]/_x/link/vivado/vpl/prj/prj.xpr` folder.

<details>
	<summary>AI Engine and PL Kernel details</summary>
	
## AI Engine and PL Kernel Details
The design implements the LeNet CNN to perform digital classification on gray scale images. The AI Engine kernels have been covered in the Tutorial Overview section above and more details will be provided in Software Design Details section.

The PL kernels perform the following functions:
*  loading input images of LeNet into block RAMs through the AXI interfaces
*  moving and rearranging data from one AI Engine to another.

The AI Engine kernels are mainly used to perform matrix multiplication due to their high INT8 MAC performance.

Most of the data processing function is handled in the PL kernel, `lenet_kernel` which comes pre-compiled and contains the following 
modules.

**Input Rearrange (IPR)**

The LeNet algorithm in this design starts with an image of size 28x28 input imported from DDR memory through the NoC. An input rearrange function is implemented in PL to arrange pixels from the input according to a 5x5 convolution kernel and pad with seven zeros to form 32 pixels to form a 576x32 matrix. The matrix is sent to the first AI Engine tile (Conv1) via AXI4-Stream to perform matrix multiplication.

**Max Pool and Data Rearrangement set 1 (M1R1)**

Pooling is the operation in CNN to enable the detection of the object when presented with different versions of the images by reducing the size of the feature map. Among the types of pooling, the max is chosen to account for distortion. 
In this design, the output from the first AI Engine tile (core01) is a 576x8 matrix, which is sent to PL. Each of the columns in the matrix correspond to a 24x24 dimensional image laid out in the row major format. The network being implemented has only six output features for the Conv1 layers and hence two of the eight columns do not contain real images. Then a maxpool operation is performed and a value is returned from a 2x2 matrix, as seen in green squares in the following diagram.

![Image of LeNet Maxpool1](images/Lenet_maxpool1.PNG)

The resulting 144 x 8 byte matrix, which is stored in RAMB36 module, then goes through a rearrange operation, where the data is written into six RAMB18s populated with zeros in the appropriate positions and the addresses are generated by the fanout table. Each RAMB18 is configured as 2048 x 8 (depth x width). The arrays then go through a second stage or rearrange operation where each array is configured in read mode and 512 x 32. These block RAMS are rearranged to four block RAMS and five register files After the rearrange function, the data is output as six images each of 64 x 25 dimension. The data for the previous image needs to be sent out to memory mapped AXI4 before the writing of the new image starts.

Also in M1R1 are two instances of the AXI2BRAM module, one at the PL-AI Engine interface and another at the AI Engine-PL interfaces. At the PL-AI Engine interface, data is coming into the module in AXI4-stream format from the AI Engine. 

The AXI stream supplies a data rate of 128 bits/cycle at 250 MHz and the is written into four 32-bit RAMB 18. A corresponding set of operations is performed at the AI Engine-PL interface.

**Max Pool and Data Rearrangement set 2 (M2R2)**

This module performs the similar operations of max pooling and data rearrangement to M1R1 but on a smaller set of the feature map. It moves and rearranges data from AI Engine tile, core02, to AI Engine tiles, core03 and core05. The output from the second AI Engine tile, core02, is sent to the PL as 16 images of 8x8 representing the 2D image as a column in a row major order is laid out as an array of 64 x 16 bytes array. Then a maxpool operation is performed and a value is returned from a 2x2 matrix. The results are stored in a register file configured as 16 images of 4x4 bytes which then are rearranged before being sent out using two AXI4-Stream to the two AI Engine tiles, core03 and core05.

**Data Mover Kernel**

The PL based data mover kernel consist of MM2S and S2MM kernels. This module gets the initial image from DDR memory through the NoC and sends the data to AI Engine tile, core01 (after input processing unit inside `lenet_kernel`). It also receives data from AI Engine tile, core04, and streams out the data to DDR memory through the NoC. The side facing NoC uses a memory mapped AXI4 interface (MM-AXI4) and the side facing the AI Engine array uses an AXI4-Stream interface.

# Software Design Details
The software design in the Lenet tutorial consists of the following sections:

<details>
  <summary>AI Engine Kernels and Graph Representation</summary>
	
## AI Engine Kernels and Graph Representation
An AI Engine kernel is a C/C++ program written using specialized intrinsic calls that target the VLIW vector processor. The AI Engine compiler compiles the kernel code to produce an executable ELF file for each of the AI Engines being used in the design. Review [AI Engine Kernel Programming Section in the AI Engine Documentation](#ai-engine-documentation) for a high-level overview of kernel programming. These kernels can be stitched together to function as AI Engine graphs written in C++. 
The AI Engine compiler writes a summary of compilation results called `lenet.aiecompile_summary`. You can view the graph by running the following command:

`vitis_analyzer build/Work/lenet.aiecompile_summary`

The following figure shows the graph representation of the AI Engine kernels. The five cores correspond to the description shown in the block diagram in the Tutorial Overview section; core01 implements the first convolutional layer, core02 implements the second convolutional layer, core03 and 05 implement FC1 and ReLu, and core04 implements the FC2.

![Image of LeNet AI Engine Graph](images/Lenet_graph.PNG)

Note also defined in the AI Engine graph are the weights (`core<xx>lut.h`). The weights are used in the matrix multiplication with the input matrix running in the AI Engine tiles. Whereas the input feature maps (IFMs) are streamed from the PL to the AI Engine, the weights are stored in the AI Engine tiles.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Data Flow Graph</summary>
	
## Data Flow Graph
This section describes the overall data-flow graph specification of the LeNet design which is compiled by the AI Engine compiler. Refer to [AI Engine Programming Section in the AI Engine Documentation](#ai-engine-documentation) for information on ADF graphs.

The overall graph definition of the design is contained in the `graph.cpp` file. The following steps describe the definition of the graph.

### Define the graph class 
Define the LeNet graph glass by using the objects defined in the appropriate name space. It must include the Adaptive Data Flow (ADF) library. All user graphs are derived from the class graph, for example in this design:

`class myGraph : public adf::graph`. 

Declare top level ports to the graph:

`public:
   adf::port<output> out[3];
   adf::port<input> in[4];
`
### Define the Graph Constructor
Use the `kernel::create` function to instantiate the C++ kernel objects, for example:

`core01 = adf::kernel::create(core01_top);`

### Add Connectivity Information 
This is done by using the templated connect<> object. The connection can be window<> or stream. If a window connection is used, then window parameters must be specified. 
In this description, ports are referred to by indices. An example of the connection between the input port of the graph and input of an AI Engine kernel is as follows:

```
adf::connect< adf::window<ROW_A * COL_A> > (in[0], core01.in[0]);
single_buffer(in[0]);
single_buffer(core01.in[0]);
```
In this case, the parameters correspond to the matrix dimension. Single buffer is selected instead of ping-pong buffer to keep the design simple without an impact on performance.

An example of connection of weights already loaded in AI Engine tile is:
```
adf::connect<>(core01lut,core01);
```
Based on the datatype of `core01lut`, the API call is inferred as a look up table in the AI Engine tile.

### Set the Source File and Tile Use 
Set the source file and tile use for each of the kernels, for example:

```
adf::source(core01) = "core01.cc";
adf::runtime<ratio>(core01) = 0.6;
```

The source file `core01.cc` contains the source code for core01. The ratio of the function run time compared to the cycle budget, known as the runtime ratio, must be between 0 and 1.

### LeNet Top level Application
Define a top level application file (`graph.cpp` in this design) that contains an instance of the graph class and connect the graph to a simulation platform to provide file input and output, for example:

```
adf::PLIO *attr_i1 = new adf::PLIO("prod_in1", adf::plio_128_bits, "data/0_1/matA_in_128plio.txt");
adf::simulation::platform<4,3> platform(attr_i1,attr_i2,attr_i3,attr_i4,attr_o1,attr_o2,attr_o3);`
myGraph g;
adf::connect<> net010(platform.src[0], g.in[0]);
```

The main program is the driver of the graph. It is used to load,execute and terminate the graph. This is done by using the Run Time Graph control API calls, which in this design are:

```int main(int argc, char ** argv)
   {
      g.init();
      g.run();
      g.end();

      return 0;
   }
```

</details>

<details>
  <summary>PL Kernels</summary>
	
## PL Kernels
In addition to kernels operating in the AI Engine array, this design specifies two kernels to run on the PL region of the device (written in HLS C++), `lenet_kernel` and `dma_hls`. Note the `dma_hls` kernel is brought into the design during the Vitis kernel compilation whereas the lenet_kernel is only brought in later in the V++ link stage since the kernel is pre-packaged.

The dma_hls kernel is an IP which contains dma_mm2s and dma_s2mm. dma_mm2s reads data from a memory-mapped AXI4 interface and writes it to an AXI4-Stream interface. `dma_s2mm` reads data from an AXI4-Stream interface and writes it to a memory-mapped AXI4 interface. The kernel specifies the following pragmas:

* #pragma HLS INTERFACE m_axi
* #pragma HLS INTERFACE axis
* #pragma HLS INTERFACE s_axilite
* #pragma HLS PIPELINE II=1
* #pragma HLS DATAFLOW
</details>

<details>
  <summary>PS Host Application</summary>
	
## PS Host Application
The LeNet tutorial uses the Embedded processing system (PS) as an external controller to control the AI Engine graph and data mover PL kernels. Review [Programming the PS Host Application Section in the AI Engine Documentation](#ai-engine-documentation) to understand the process to create a host application. 

In addition to the PS host application (`main.cpp`), the AI Engine control code must also be compiled. This control code (`aie_control_xrt.cpp`) is generated by the AI Engine compiler when compiling the AI Engine design graph and kernel code. 
The AI Engine control code is used by the PS host application for the following reasons:
* Control the initial loading of the AI Engine kernels
* Run the graph for several iterations, update the run time parameters associated with the graph, exit, and reset the AI Engine tiles.

The PS Host application stack diagram for the LeNet tutorial is shown in the following diagram.

![Alt Text](images/Lenet_PS_stack_20202.PNG)

The steps in the tutorial to run the A72 application are described as follows:

### 1. Include graph.cpp
Include the `graph.cpp` AI Engine application file. This file contains the instantiation of the AI Engine LeNet data flow graph object
```
#include graph.cpp
``` 

### 2. Check Command Line Argument
The beginning of the A72 application is represented by the main function. It takes in one command line argument: an XCLBIN file.

`int main(int argc, char** argv)`

### 3. Open XCLBIN and Create Data Mover Kernel Handles
The A72 application loads the XCLBIN binary file and creates the data mover kernels to be executed on the device. The steps are:
* Open device and load xclbin
```
auto dhdl = xrtDeviceOpen(0);
auto xclbin = load_xclbin(dhdl, xclbinFilename);
auto top = reinterpret_cast<const axlf*>(xclbin.data());
```

* Create the data mover kernel

`xrtKernelHandle dmahls_khdl = xrtPLKernelOpen(dhdl, top->m_header.uuid, "dma_hls");`

### 4. Allocate Buffers for Input Data and Results in Global Memory
The A72 application allocates BO (buffer objects) to store input data and output results in global memory (DDR). For example:
```
xrtBufferHandle in_bohdl = xrtBOAlloc(dhdl, input_size_in_bytes,  0, 0);
auto in_bomapped = reinterpret_cast<uint32_t*>(xrtBOMap(in_bohdl));
```
Additionally, the `memcpy` and `memset` functions are used to initialize the data in global memory.

### 5. Open Graph, Obtain Handle and Execute Graph
The following registration function is added in 2020.2 for XRT to use ADF API callbacks:

`adf::registerXRT(dhdl, top->m_header.uuid);`

* The A72 processor opens and obtains its handle using the ` xrtGraphOpen` function.
* The A72 processor resets the graph using the `xrtGraphReset` function and runs the LeNet graph execution using the `xrtGraphRun` function.
Note there is no reading or updating of coefficients in the LeNet design.

### 6. Execute the Data Mover Kernels and Generate the Output Results
* Open the PL kernels and obtain handles with `xrtPLKernelOpen` function.
* Create kernel handle to start `dma_hls` PL kernel using `xrtRunOpen` function.
* Set the `dma_hls` kernel arguments using `xrtRunSetArg` function.
* Start the `dma_hls` kernels using `xrtRunStart` function.
* Wait for `dma_hls` execution to finish using `xrtRunWait` runction.
* Close the run handles and close opened kernel handles using `xrtRunClose` and `xrtKernelClose`.

### 7. Verify Output Results
Compare data in `out_bomapped` to golden reference data in `golden.h`.

### 8. Release Allocated Resources
After post-processing the data, release the allocated objects using `xrtBOFree`, `xrtGraphClose` and `xrtDeviceClose` functions.
