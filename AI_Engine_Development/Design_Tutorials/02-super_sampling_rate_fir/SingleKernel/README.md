# Single-Kernel FIR Filter Implementation

In this first part of the tutorial you will use a basic filtering application and analyze the performance that can be achieved.

Navigate to the `SingleKernel` directory to continue.

## Filter Description

Thoughout this tutorial you will use and reuse the same filter with complex coefficients. This filter has 32 coefficients (or taps) and has no symmetry characteristics.

```
{   -82,  -253},{     0,  -204},{    11,   -35},{  -198,   273},
{  -642,   467},{ -1026,   333},{  -927,     0},{  -226,   -73},
{   643,   467},{   984,  1355},{   550,  1691},{     0,   647},
{   538, -1656},{  2860, -3936},{  6313, -4587},{  9113, -2961},
{  9582,     0},{  7421,  2411},{  3936,  2860},{  1023,  1409},
{  -200,  -615},{     0, -1778},{   517, -1592},{   467,  -643},
{  -192,   140},{  -882,   287},{ -1079,     0},{  -755,  -245},
{  -273,  -198},{    22,    30},{    63,   194},{     0,   266}
```

The output of this filter will have a much higher amplitude than the input. A scaling factor of `2^15` should be applied to get back to normalized data. On debugging phase, when only impulses are given to the filter, the scaling factor can be reduced to `1` so that we can verify that the output looks like the impulse response of the filter.

## Designing the Kernel

Before building a kernel to implement FIR filtering, consider the following:
- What kind of interface will I use?
- How many coefficients do I have?
  - How will it influence the size of the data register and coefficient register?
  - How many lanes can I use in my intrinsics?
- When will I schedule data reading and writing?

### Interfaces

There are two types of interfaces: windows and streams. The bandwidth of the memory (where windows are stored) access is much higher than the streams: 2x32 GB/s vs. 2x4 GB/s. Even if the memory bandwidth from the processor is very high, they must be filled in either by another AI Engine (bandwidth 32 GB/s) or streams (2x4GB/s). Either way, somewhere in the cascade  of kernels the origin of the data will be outside of the AI Engine array (PL, DDR, ...) implying a stream source.

Window interfaces are used in a 'ping-pong' manner to allow for continuous data transfer while maintaining continuous processing. When multiple kernels are mapped to the same AI Engine and they communicate through windows, these windows use a single buffer because the kernels do not run at the same time. Ping-pong buffering means that the data are processed only when the buffer is completely filled in, incurring a minimum latency of the duration of this buffer filling. When an AI Engine kernel uses window interfaces, it must acquire a lock to gain access ownership to this memory. Lock acquisition and release takes a minimum of seven cycles per lock, which reduces the time allowed for processing.

As a rule of thumb, 750 Msps is the maximum sample rate for which window interfaces are a viable solution. When the kernel processing duration is just a fraction of the time it takes to fill in the input window, this is reflected by a **utilization ratio** much below 1 and multiple kernels can be mapped onto a single AI Engine.

In this tutorial, the goal is to achieve the maximum performance filter implementation, leading to a streaming interface at the input and the output.

### Data and Coefficients Management

The data register is limited to 1024 bits (`v32cint16`) and the coefficient register maximum bitwidth is 512 bits (`v16cint16`). Having a streaming interface (single stream to start with), four `cint16` can be read in one instruction, but it takes four clock cycles to be able to perform the same operation again. Reading four samples at a time allows the use of `mul4` and `mac4` intrinsics.

Not all intrinics exist for the AI Engine. Only two intrinsics will handle four lanes for complex 16 bits x complex 16 bits:

<img src="../Images/Mul4Intrinsics.jpg" width=800><br>

In this tutorial finite length loops (by default 512 input/ouput samples) are assumed for ease of debugging. This number of iterations can be increased as desired up to infinite loops (`while(1) { ...}`). Between two calls of the kernel, the status of the delay-line of the filter needs to be maintained. This delay-line must be at least 31 samples for a 32-tap filter. 32 samples fit in a Y register that's why we will use a `v32cint16` variable to keep this delay-line. At the beginning of the kernel call this delay-line will be loaded from the memory, and at the end it will be stored there. For the coefficients there is no option: it will be `v8cint16`.

A `mul4` operating on `cint16` x `cint16` can perform eight operations in one clock cycle, leading to two operations per lane.

### Coefficients and Data Update Scheduling

Before the first iteration the delay-line, the status is read to update the Y register. It will contain all the necessary previous data: `{ d(-32), d(-31), ... , d(-2), d(-1)}`. The first output will be the result of the following operation:

`y(0) = d(-31).c(0) + d(-30).c(1) + ... + d(-1).c(30) + d(0).c(31)`

where the array `c` is the array of coefficients. Use a table to organize operations scheduling (excel for example):

<img src="../Images/FirstMul4Operation.jpg" width=800><br>

This image represents the following equation:

<img src="../Images/FirstMul4Operation_eq.jpg" width=300><br>

Following this first `mul4` operation 15 `mac4` operations should be used to finih the computation of `{y(0), y(1), y(2), y(3)}`.

Use darker and darker green to represent the next three `mac4` operations

<img src="../Images/FourFirstMul4Operations.jpg" width=800><br>

With these operations performed, the eight coefficients that were in the the `v8cint16` have been used, and it is time to update them. These operations should be followed by eight `mac4` operations:

<img src="../Images/NextFourMul4Operations.jpg" width=800><br>

The next block of four `mac4` operations will wrap around and reuse the begining of the data register. It is time to load four new samples from the stream and finish the operations:

<img src="../Images/LastFourMac4Operations.jpg" width=800><br>

Now that the computation of `{y(0), y(1), y(2), y(3)}` has been completed, the next four outputs `{y(4), y(5), y(6), y(7)}` have to be computed. As can be seen in the previous image, the next computation must start with index 5 in the data register. As in the previous set of output samples, the data register will be updated just before the group of four `mac4`:

<img src="../Images/SecondSetOfOutputs.jpg" width=800><br>

In order to have a regular inner loop, 32 output samples (eight groups of four) will be computed in the inner loop.

Now take a look at the related C code to implement all these operations. The program takes advantage of the templatization of the function and of the inclusion of the state in the class itself:

```C++
namespace SingleStream {

template<int NSamples,int ShiftAcc>
class FIR_SingleStream {
private:
	alignas(32) cint16 weights[32];
	alignas(32) cint16 delay_line[32];

public:
	FIR_SingleStream(const cint16 (&taps)[32])
	{
		for(int i=0;i<32;i++)
		{
			weights[i] = taps[i];
			delay_line[i] = (cint16){0,0};
		}
	};

	void filter(input_stream_cint16*  sin,output_stream_cint16*  sout);

	static void registerKernelClass()
	{
		REGISTER_FUNCTION(FIR_SingleStream::filter);
	};
};

}
```
The taps will be provided during instantiation of the class. The constructor initializes the internal array and sets the delay line to zero. In the template, two arguments define the number of iterations of the inner loop and the shifting value that will be applied to the accumulator before sending the calculated y-values to the output stream.


Function, declaration, and variable initialization are as follows:

```C++
template <int NSamples,int ShiftAcc>
void FIR_SingleStream<NSamples,ShiftAcc>::filter(input_stream_cint16* sin,output_stream_cint16* sout)
{
	v8cint16 *coeff =  (v8cint16*) weights;
	v8cint16 taps = undef_v8cint16();
	v32cint16 *ptr_delay_line = (v32cint16 *)delay_line;
	v32cint16 data = *ptr_delay_line;

	v4cacc48 acc = undef_v4cacc48();
    ...
```
The function `filter` has two stream arguments: `sin` and `sout` for stream-in and stream-out. The pointers to the coefficients and the data are prepared so that they can be loaded using pointer addressing.

```C++
// Computes 32 samples per iteration
	for(int i=0;i<NSamples/32;i++)
		chess_prepare_for_pipelining
		chess_loop_range(NSamples/32,NSamples/32)
	{
        taps =  *coeff++;   // Get the coefficients for the Green block
        acc = mul4(data,1,0x3210,1,taps,0,0x0000,1);
        acc = mac4(acc,data,3+2,0x3210,1,taps,2,0x0000,1);
        acc = mac4(acc,data,5,0x3210,1,taps,4,0x0000,1);
        acc = mac4(acc,data,7,0x3210,1,taps,6,0x0000,1);

        taps =  *coeff++;   // get the coefficients for the Blue block
        acc = mac4(acc,data,9,0x3210,1,taps,0,0x0000,1);
        acc = mac4(acc,data,11,0x3210,1,taps,2,0x0000,1);
        acc = mac4(acc,data,13,0x3210,1,taps,4,0x0000,1);
        acc = mac4(acc,data,15,0x3210,1,taps,6,0x0000,1);

        taps =  *coeff++;   // Get the coefficients for the yellow-brown block
        acc = mac4(acc,data,17,0x3210,1,taps,0,0x0000,1);
        acc = mac4(acc,data,19,0x3210,1,taps,2,0x0000,1);
        acc = mac4(acc,data,21,0x3210,1,taps,4,0x0000,1);
        acc = mac4(acc,data,23,0x3210,1,taps,6,0x0000,1);

        data = upd_v(data,0,readincr_v4(sin));  // Update the data register

        taps =  *coeff++;   // Get the coefficients for the Grey block
        acc = mac4(acc,data,25,0x3210,1,taps,0,0x0000,1);
        acc = mac4(acc,data,27,0x3210,1,taps,2,0x0000,1);
        acc = mac4(acc,data,29,0x3210,1,taps,4,0x0000,1);
        acc = mac4(acc,data,31,0x3210,1,taps,6,0x0000,1);

        writeincr_v4(sout,srs(acc,ShiftAcc)); // Write on the output stream
        coeff -= 4;     // Realign the coefficients pointer
        ...
```

These four blocks have to be written eight times with different parameters to compute the 32 output samples. In the code that is published, two macros are defined to make this exercise a little easier:

```C++
#define MULMAC(N) \
		taps =  *coeff++; \
		acc = mul4(data,N,0x3210,1,taps,0,0x0000,1); \
		acc = mac4(acc,data,N+2,0x3210,1,taps,2,0x0000,1);\
		acc = mac4(acc,data,N+4,0x3210,1,taps,4,0x0000,1);\
		acc = mac4(acc,data,N+6,0x3210,1,taps,6,0x0000,1)

#define MACMAC(N) \
		taps =  *coeff++; \
		acc = mac4(acc,data,N,0x3210,1,taps,0,0x0000,1); \
		acc = mac4(acc,data,N+2,0x3210,1,taps,2,0x0000,1);\
		acc = mac4(acc,data,N+4,0x3210,1,taps,4,0x0000,1);\
		acc = mac4(acc,data,N+6,0x3210,1,taps,6,0x0000,1)
```

## Compilation and Analysis

Ensure that the `InitPythonPath` has been sourced in the `Utils` directory.

Navigate to the `SingleKernel` directory. In the `Makefile`, three methods are defined:
- `compile`
  - Compiles the graph and the kernels
- `simulate`
  - Runs the AI Engine System C simulator
- `visualize`
  - Runs `vitis_analyzer`on the output summary

Have a look at the source code (kernel and graph) to familiarize yourself with the C++ instanciation of kernels. In `graph.cpp` the PL AI Engine connections are declared using 64-bit interfaces running at 500 MHz, allowing for maximum bandwidth on the AI Engine array AXI-Stream network.

To have the simulation running, input data must be generated. Change directory to `data` and type `GenerateStreams`. The following parameter should be set for this example:

<img src="../Images/GenerateSingleStream.jpg" width=800><br>

Click on **Generate** then on **Exit**. The generated file `PhaseIn_0.txt` should contain mainly 0's, with a few 1's and 10's.

Type `make all` and wait for `vitis_analyzer` GUI to display. The Vitis analyzer is able to show the graph, how it has been implemented in the device, and the complete timeline of the simulation. In this specific case the graph is very simple (a single kernel) and the implementation is on a single AI Engine.

Click **Graph** to visualize the graph of the application:

<img src="../Images/GraphSingleKernel.jpg" width=800><br>

Click **Array** to visualize where the kernel has been placed, and how it is fed from the the PL:

<img src="../Images/ArraySingleKernel.jpg" width=200><br>

Finally click on **Trace** to look how the entire simulation went through. This may be useful to track where your AI Engine stalls if performance is not as expected:

<img src="../Images/TimelineSingleKernel.jpg" width=1000><br>

As explained earlier, the directory `Utils` contains a number of utilities that will help in analyzing the design output. First, the output value has to be validated. The input being a set of Dirac impulses, the impulse response of the filter should be recognized throughout the waveform. Navigate to `Emulation-AIE/aiesimulator_output/data` and look at the `Output_0.txt`. You can see that you have two complex outputs per line which is prepended with a time stamp.  `ProcessAIEOutput Output_0.txt`.

<img src="../Images/GraphOutputSingleKernel.jpg" width=1000><br>

The top graph reflects the outputs where the abscissa is at the time at which this output occurred. It is much easier to look at the bottom graph where the samples are displayed one after the other. The filter impulse can be easily recognized on this sub-graph. The file `out.txt` contains three columns: (timestamp, real part, and imaginary part) of the output samples.

The throughput can be computed from the timeline, but a tool has been created for you in the `Utils` directory to compute it from the output files. In the same directory (`Emulation-AIE/aiesimulator_output/data`) type `StreamThroughput Output_0.txt`:

```
Output_0.txt -->   225.28 Msps

-----------------------

Total Throughput -->     225.28 Msps
```

Each four output samples need 16 `mul4`/`mac4` instructions, so the maximum throughput attainable is 250 Msps which is in line with what was achieved.
