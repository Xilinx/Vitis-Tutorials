## Design Tutorials

The AI Engine Development Design Tutorials showcase the two major phases of AI Engine-ML application development: architecting the application and developing the kernels. Both phases are demonstrated in these tutorials.

 <td align="center"><a href="../../../Developer_Contributed/01-Versal_Custom_Thin_Platform_Extensible_System/">Versal Custom Thin Platform Extensible System</a></td>
 <td>This is a Versal system example design based on a VEK280 thin custom platform (Minimal clocks and AXI exposed to PL) that includes HLS/RTL kernels and AI Engine kernel using a full Makefile build-flow.</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
 <td align="center"><a href="./01-AIE-ML-programming-and-optimization/">AIE-ML Programming</a></td>
 <td>This tutorial helps user understand the differences between AI Engine and AI Engine-ML architecture, it is based on matrix multiplication which is a usual algorithm in Machine Learning applications. </td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
 <td align="center"><a href="./02-Prime-Factor-FFT/">Prime Factor FFT-1008 on AIE-ML</a></td>
 <td>This Versal system example implements a 1008-pt FFT using the Prime Factor algorithm. The design uses both AI Engine and PL kernels working cooperatively. AI Engine elements are hand-coded using AIE API, PL elements are implemented using Vitis HLS. System integration in Vitis is managed using the new v++ Unified Command Line flow. This tutorial targets the AIE-ML architecture. </td>

 <tr>
 <td align="center"><a href="./03-AIE-ML-lenet_tutorial/">AIE-ML LeNet Tutorial</a></td>
 <td>This tutorial uses the LeNet algorithm to implement a system-level design to perform image classification using the AIE-ML architecture and PL logic, including block RAM (BRAM). The design demonstrates functional partitioning between the AIE-ML and PL. It also highlights memory partitioning and hierarchy among DDR memory, PL (BRAM), Memory tile and AI Engine memory. </td>
