Welcome to AMD Vitis™ Getting Started to explore beginner-friendly tutorials. The tutorials here walk you through the procedure of building a design with Vitis, Vitis HLS, and Libraries and how to create a Vitis platform from start to finish, showing you the overall design process and how to use basic features.

   * - Tutorial
     - Description
	 
   * - :doc:`Vitis Introduction and Getting Started <./docs/Vitis/README>`
     - An overview of the Vitis workflow including kernel development, host software creation, emulation, implementation, and analysis. This tutorial is divided into separate flows:

       - Data Center
       - Embedded Processor
       - Vitis Unified IDE

   * - :doc:`Vitis HLS <./docs/Vitis_HLS/README>`
     - See In-Depth how to optimize, implement, and unit test individual hardware accelerators from within the Vitis High-Level Synthesis environment.

   * - :doc:`Vitis Libraries <./docs/Vitis_Libraries/README>`
     - Learn how to leverage a L1 Vitis library element to build your own design. The FFT example is selected for explanation, and you may follow similar flow to use other library elements.

   * - :doc:`Vitis Platform <./docs/Vitis_Platform/README>`
     - This tutorial shows how to quickly create and validate a Vitis embedded acceleration platform on AMD Versal™ by using the Versal Extensible Platform from AMD Vivado™ Customizable Example Design and pre-built Linux common images.
