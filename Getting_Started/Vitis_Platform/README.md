# Versal Platform Creation Quick Start

***Vitis Unified IDE 2023.2***, ***Vivado 2023.2***

***Board: VCK190 VEK280***

In this module, we will get started with three steps to quickly create a platform and run applications to validate this platform based on VCK190 or VEK280 evaluation board in short. 

This time, we will utilize AMD Versal™ extensible platform from the CED example, using pre-built Linux common image and `createdts` command to generate software components. And then create an embedded Versal acceleration platform with AMD Vitis™ Unified IDE. At last, leverage the Vector Addition example to validate this platform. 

This is a quick start for Versal platform creation. If you have queries about some steps or settings or want to create a platform for customer's board, refer to [Versal Custom Platform Creation Tutorial](../../Vitis_Platform_Creation/Design_Tutorials/03_Edge_VCK190/). Besides, if you need to customize the Linux system image, refer to the [PetaLinux customization page](../../Vitis_Platform_Creation/Feature_Tutorials/02_petalinux_customization/README.md) for reference.

## Step 1: Create Vivado Design and Generate XSA

1. Create a workspace and launch AMD Vivado™ 

   - mkdir WorkSpace
   - cd WorkSpace
   - Run `source <Vitis_Install_Directory>/settings64.sh` to setup Vivado running environment
   - Run Vivado by typing `vivado` in the console.

2. Download the Versal Extensible Embedded Platform Example
   
   - Click menu **Tools -> Vivado Store.**
   - Click **OK** to agree to download open source examples from web.
   - Select **Platform -> Versal Extensible Embedded Platform** and click the download button on the tool bar.
   - Click **Close** after installation complete.

   ![Vivado XHUB download examples](images/vivado_download_example.png)

3. Create the Versal Extensible Embedded Platform Example project

   - Click **File -> Project -> Open Example**.
   - Click **Next**.
   - Select **Versal Extensible Embedded Platform** in Select Project Template window.
   - Input **project name** and **project location**. Keep **Create project subdirectory** checked. Click **Next**.
   - Select target board in Default Part window. In this example, we use **Versal VCK190 Evaluation Platform**. Click **Next**.

      >Note: Please select **Versal VEK280 Pre-production** board if you target vek280.
  
   ![CED Configuration](./images/vivado_ced_config.png)

   - Configure Clocks Settings. You can enable more clocks, update output frequency and define default clock in this view. In this example, we can keep the default settings.
   - Configure AXI master and Interrupt Settings. You can choose how many interrupt and AXI masters this platform should support. 63 interrupts modes use two AXI_INTC in cascade mode. In this example, we can keep the default setting.
   - Enable the AI engine according to your requirement. In this example, we can keep the default setting.
   - Click **Next**.
   - Review the new project summary and click **Finish**.
   - After a while, the design example is generated.

   The generated design is shown in the following figure:

   ![Vivado Design Block Diagram](images/vivado_design_diagram.png)


   At this stage, the Vivado block automation has added a Control, Interface & Processing System (shorten with CIPS in the future) block, AXI NOC block, AI Engine, and all supporting logic blocks to the diagram, and applied all board presets for the VCK190 or VEK280. 

   >Note: The block design of the VEk280 is slightly different from that of the VCK190. While the VCK190 incorporates one DDR4 and one LPDDR4, the VEK280 elevates its performance with the inclusion of two LPDDR4s.
   
4. Generate Block Diagram

   - Click **Generate Block Diagram** from the Flow Navigator window.

   ![missing image](images/vivado_generate_bd.png)

   - Select **Synthesis Options** to **Global** to save generation time. 

   ![missing image](images/vivado_generate_bd_global.png)

   - Click **Generate** button.

   **Note**: It is safe to ignore this critical warning. Vitis will connect this signal in the future.

   ![Intr Critical Warning ](images/vivado_bd_critical_warning.png)

5. Export hardware platform with the following scripts:

   - Click **File -> Export -> Export Platform**. Alternative ways are: **Flow Navigator** window: **IP Integrator -> Export Platform**, or the **Export Platform** button on the bottom of **Platform Setup** tab.
   - Click **Next** on Export Hardware Platform page.
   - Select **Hardware and hardware emulation**.  Click **Next**.
   - Select **Pre-synthesis**, because we are not making an DFX platform. Click **Next**.
   - Input Name: **Custom_Platform**, click Next.
   - Update file XSA file name to **vck190_custom**, click Next.
   - Review the summary. Click **Finish**.
   - **vck190_custom.xsa** file is generated in Vivado project location directory.

   >Note: If there are any IPs that do not support simulation, generate Hardware XSA and Hardware Emulation XSA separately.

   >Note: If you target VEK280, please update XSA name to **vek280_custom**.

## Step 2: Create Vitis Platform

1. Download Versal common image from [AMD website download page](https://www.xilinx.com/support/download.html), place it under your `WorkSpace` directory, and extract the common image.

   ```bash
   tar xvf ../xilinx-versal-common-v2023.2.tar.gz .
   ```

2. Create the device tree file
   Device tree describes the hardware components of the system. `createdts` command can generate the device tree file according to the hardware configurations from XSA file. If there are any settings not available in XSA, for example, any driver nodes that do not have corresponding hardware, or the user has their own design hardware, the user needs to add customization settings in `system-user.dtsi`.

   Besides, uboot in common image does not have default environment variables. So update the bootargs manually. A pre-prepared [system-user.dtsi](ref_files/system-user.dtsi) file, which adds pre-defined bootargs is under `ref_files` directory. Copy `system-user.dtsi` to `WorkSpace` directory and follow below steps to generate the DTB file.

   ```bash
   cd WorkSpace
   source <Vitis_Install_Directory>/settings64.sh
   xsct 
   ```
   Then execute `createdts` command in XSCT console like the following:

   ```bash
   createdts -hw <full path>/vck190_custom.xsa -out . -zocl \
   -platform-name mydevice -git-branch xlnx_rel_v2023.2 -board versal-vck190-reva-x-ebm-02-reva -dtsi system-user.dtsi -compile   
   ```

   >Note: If you target VEK280, please specify the XSA  to **vek280_custom.xsa**  and board to **versal-vek280-revb**.

   Notice that `-hw ` option is your XSA file generated in step1 located in your Vivado Project directory named `vck190_custom.xsa`. Besides, the following information would show in XSCT console. Ignore the following warning and that means you succeed to get system.dtb file, which is located in `mydevice/psv_cortexa72_0/device_tree_domain/bsp/`.

   ```bash
   pl.dtsi:9.21-46.4: Warning (unit_address_vs_reg): /amba_pl@0: node has a unit name, but no reg property
   pl.dtsi:41.26-45.5: Warning (simple_bus_reg): /amba_pl@0/misc_clk_0: missing or empty reg/ranges property
   ```

   Type `exit` in console to exit XSCT console.

3. Create Vitis platform

   - Install SDK tool by typing `sh xilinx-versal-common-v2023.2/sdk.sh -d xilinx-versal-common-v2023.2/ -y` in console. Option `-d` is to specify the directory where to install. Option `-y` means confirmation. So it gets installed in `xilinx-versal-common-v2023.2/` folder.
   - Run Vitis by typing `vitis -w .` in the console. **-w** is to specify the workspace. `.` means the current workspace.
   - In the Vitis IDE, select **File > New Component > Platform** to create a platform component.
   - Enter the **Component name**. For this example, type `vck190_custom`, click **Next**.

      >Note: If you target VEK280, please update component name to **vek280_custom**.

   - In the XSA selecting page, click **Browse** button, select the XSA file generated by the Vivado. In this case, it is `Your Vivado Project Directory>/vck190_custom.xsa` or `vek280_custom.xsa`. Click **Next**.
   - Set the **operating system** to **linux** and set the processor to **psv_cortexa72**. Click **Next**.
   - Review the summary and click **Finish**.

   ![Created Vitis Platform](images/created_vitis_platform.png)

   - Click the **linux On psv_cortexa72** domain.
   - Update the **Display Name** to `xrt` by clicking the entry bar and inputting the name. It is indicated that this is a Linux domain has XRT installed and can run acceleration applications.
   - Set **Bif file**: Click the button as shown in the following diagram and generate BIF file. The BIF file is generated in the resource directory.
  
      ![vitis_platform_config](images/vitis_platform_config.PNG)

   - **Pre-Built Image Directory**: Browse to extracted common image path directory: `xilinx-versal-common-v2023.2/` and click OK. Bootgen looks for boot components referred by BIF in this directory to generate `BOOT.BIN`.
   - **DTB file**: Browse to the DTB file location we created just now. It is under `mydevice/psv_cortexa72_0/device_tree_domain/bsp/`. Select system.dtb and click **OK**
   - **FAT32 Partition Directory**: if you have additional file to be stored in FAT32 partition diretory you can browse to the file. If not please omit this.
   - **QEMU Data**: This Directory is used to add additional file for emulation. User can set it according to your requirement.
   - In the flow navigator, click the drop-down button to select the component. In this case, select **vck190_custom** component and click the **Build** button to build the platform.
   - 
   >Note: If there are additional QEMU settings, update `qemu_args.txt` accordingly.
   
   After this step2, the platform creation process is completed. Next, run an application to validate this platform.

## Step 3: Validate this Vitis PLatform

   - Run Vitis by typing `vitis -w .` in the console (If you have launched Vitis, omit this step).
   - In the view, Click **Example** button and expand the **Installed Examples Repository** directory like the following:

   ![missing image](./images/vitis_examples.PNG)

   - Select **Simple Vector Addition**, and click **Create application from template**.
   - Input the **System project name**: `vadd` and click **Next**.
   - Select the platform we created in previous step. In this case, it is `vck190_custom` platform.

      >Note: If you target VEK280, please select `vek280_custom` platform.

   - Input **Sysroot** path: `xilinx-versal-common-v2023.2/sysroots/cortexa72-cortexa53-xilinx-linux`
   - Input **RootFS** path: `xilinx-versal-common-v2023.2/rootfs.ext4`
   - Input **Kernel Image** path: `xilinx-versal-common-v2023.2/Image` and click **Next**.
   - Review the project summary and click **Finish**.

   After seconds, the project is created.
   ![missing image](./images/vitis_create_vadd.png)

   - Select Component **vadd** in flow navigator. Click **Build all** under **HARDWARE** target. A window pops up prompting to choose which modules to compile. Select all and click OK.

   ![missing image](./images/vitis_system_component_select.PNG)

   - It takes some time to build hardware. Finally, Vitis generates **sd_card.img** in `vadd/build/hw/package/package/` directory.

#### Run the Application on Hardware

1. Copy `vadd/build/hw/package/package/sd_card.img` to local if you build the project on a remote server or virtual machine.

2. Program sd_card.img to SD card. Refer to [AR#73711](https://www.xilinx.com/support/answers/73711.html) for detailed steps.

   > Note: Eject the SD card properly from the system after programming it.

3. Connect to UART console.

4. Insert the SD card and boot the VCK190 board with SD boot mode (SW1[4:1] = "1110": OFF, OFF, OFF, ON) and power on.

   > Note: Refer to [VCK190 Evaluation Board User Guide](https://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/boards_and_kits/vck190/ug1366-vck190-eval-bd.pdf) for details about boot mode.

5. Launch the test application from UART console.

   <summary><strong>Follow below steps to run the application</strong></summary>

     Login with user `petalinux` first and setup a new password (it is then also the sudo password):

     - Log into the system
     
     ```bash
     petalinux login:petalinux
     You are required to change your password immediately (administrator enforced).
     New password:
     Retype new password:
     petalinux:~$ sudo su
     We trust you have received the usual lecture from the local System
     Administrator. It usually boils down to these three things:
         #1) Respect the privacy of others.
         #2) Think before you type.
         #3) With great power comes great responsibility.
     Password:
     petalinux:/home/petalinux#
     ```

     - Go to auto mounted FAT32 partition and run the application as shown below:

     ```

### Fast Track

Scripts are provided to package and test the Vitis platform.

To use these scripts, download Versal common image from [AMD website download page](https://www.xilinx.com/support/download.html) and give its path to the following command.

1. Run build

   ```bash
   # cd to the ref_files directory, e.g.
   cd ref_files/<board>
   make all COMMON_IMAGE_VERSAL=<path/to/common_image/>  #Specify the path of the common image
   ```
   This command is to generate platform with pre-built software components and do sw emulation by running vadd application to test this platform.

   ```
   make sd_card COMMON_IMAGE_VERSAL=<path/to/common_image/>  #Specify the path of the common image
   ```
   This command is to generate platform with pre-built software components and do hw test on board by running vadd application to test this platform.



2. To clean the generated files, run

   ```bash
   make clean
   ```
