Welcome to Vitis Getting Started to explore beginner-friendly tutorials. The tutorials here walk you through the procedure of building a design with Vitis, Vitis HLS and Libraries and how to create a Vitis platform from start to finish, showing you the overall design process and how to use the basic features.

* [**Vitis Introduction and Getting Started**](./Vitis) :
  + An overview of the Vitis workflow including kernel development, host software creation, emulation, implementation, and analysis. This tutorial is divided into two separate flows: 
    * The Data Center flow
    * The Embedded Processor flow

* [**Vitis HLS**](./Vitis_HLS) :
  * See In-Depth how to optimize, implement, and unit test individual hardware accelerators from within the Vitis High-Level Synthesis environment
  * This tutorial contains instructions for both Vitis Unified IDE and Vitis HLS GUI

* [**Vitis Libraries**](./Vitis_Libraries) :
  * Learn how to leverage a L1 Vitis library element to build your own design. The FFT example is selected for explanation, and you may follow similar flow to use other library elements.

* [**Vitis Platform**](./Vitis_Platform) :
  * This tutorial shows how to quickly create and validate a Vitis embedded acceleration platform on Versal by using the Versal Extensible Platform from Vivado Customizable Example Design and pre-built Linux common images.
  * This tutorial uses Vitis Unified IDE.
