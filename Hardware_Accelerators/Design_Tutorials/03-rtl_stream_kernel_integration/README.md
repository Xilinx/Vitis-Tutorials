## RTL Kernel: rtc_gen (XO)

*rtc_gen* is the real-time clock digit image generation kernel written in Verilog HDL. *rtc_gen* has an internal always-run real-time-clock driven by AXI bus clock with a clock divider. The time value can be set by host via kernel arguments. The kernel will firstly load the font image library for digits 0-9 from global memory to on-chip buffer, then output the real-time-clock digit image through AXI stream port. The user can also read out the time value from the internal always-run time counter.

The character size in the font library is 240 (height) by 160 (width) pixels, and the font library includes 11 characters, i.e. digits 0-9 and colon. Refer to the image below for the font library contents.  

<div align="center">
<img src="./doc/images/font_lib.png" alt="Font Library" >
</div>
<br/><br/>

Each pixel in the font library is represented with 4-bit, which is actually the opacity value for each pixel. When output through AXI stream port, the 4-bit opacity value will be expanded to 8-bit by left shifting 4-bit then add 15 (i.e., expand 0xB to 0xBF). The opacity value will be used by the downstream alpha-mixing kernel to generate time digit with color setting. The font image data size for single chracter is:
~~~
  240 x 160 x 4 = 153,600 bits = 19,200 bytes
~~~

The total font image library size is:

~~~
  19,200 x 11 = 211,200 bytes
~~~

*rtc_gen* support two time format: one is with centi-second, namely HOUR:MIN:SEC:CENTISEC, including 11 characters; the other is without centi-second, namely HOUR:MIN:SEC, including 8 chracters. The time format is set in kernel arguments. Refer to the figures below for examples of the two output time format.

<div align="center">
<img src="./doc/images/time_format.png" alt="Time Format" >
</div>

The *rtc_gen* kernel has three bus interfaces:
+ AXI-Lite slave interface for kernel argument and control
+ AXI-Lite master interface for font library data loading
+ AXI stream master interface for clock digit image output

The kernel is composed of three blocks: *rtc_gen_axi_read_master* for AXI master based font library reading, *rtc_gen_control_s_axi* for AXI slave based kernel arguments and control, and *rtc_gen_core* for core kernel function and AXI stream output. *rtc_gen_axi_read_master* is a standard block generated by Vitis/Vivado RTL Kernel Wizard. *rtc_gen_control_s_axi* is also a generated block, but we need to make some modifications to it to add time value read-out function.

<div align="center">
<img src="./doc/images/rtc_gen_block.png" alt="rtc_gen Block" >
</div>

When trigger by the host, the kernel will read time value from internel real-time-clock, and output a frame of time image corresponding to the time value.

Following table summarizes the arguments used by *rtc_gen* kernel.

## Bitstream Implementation (XCLBIN)

### rtc_gen_test_hw.xclbin / rtc_gen_test_hw_emu.xclbin

This is a simple test system for *rtc_gen* kernel, which integrates two kernels: *rtc_gen* and *strm_dump*, which are connected together using AXI stream bus. Refer to the following connection diagram on U50 platform. According to the different building target (hw or hw_emu), two XCLBIN files will be generated.

<div align="center">
<img src="./doc/images/rtc_gen_test_diagram.png" alt="rtc_gen_test Diagram" >
</div>

### rtc_alpha_hw.xclbin / rtc_alpha_hw_emu.xclbin

This is the fully implemented system, which integrated all the three kernels: *rtc_gen*, *alpha_mix* and *strm_dump*, which are connected together via AXI stream bus. Please note the function of the kernel *strm_dump* is very easy to be merged into *alpha_mix* kernel. We seperated the *strm_dump* kernel here just to demostrate the kernel-to-kernel AXI stream connection functionality. Refer to the following connection diagram on U50 platform. According to the different building target (hw or hw_emu), two XCLBIN files will be generated.

<div align="center">
<img src="./doc/images/rtc_alpha_diagram.png" alt="rtc_alpha Diagram" >
</div>

## Test Program

### rtc_gen_test.cpp

This program first judge the running mode according to the environment variable *XCL_EMULATION_MODE*, then choose to  use binary file *rtc_gen_test_hw.xclbin* or *rtc_gen_test_hw_emu.xclbin* to finish the testing of RTL kernel *rtc_gen*. It will test both the 8-digit and 11-digit clock format, and the generated clock image will be displayed directly. The program also uses XRT low-level API *xclRegRead* to read and print out the value of regsiter *time_val* of *rtc_gen* kernel, namely the value of the internal hardware time counter. The value of *time_val* is also used to control the image display refresh. To ensure the correct operation of *xclRegRead* function, please ensure to create or modify *xrt.ini* file in the execution directory to add following lines:

~~~
[Runtime]
exclusive_cu_context=true
~~~
### rtc_alpha_tb.cpp

This program first judge the running mode according to the environment variable *XCL_EMULATION_MODE*, then choose to use binary file *rtc_alpha_hw.xclbin* or *rtc_alpha_hw_emu.xclbin* to mix the generated real time clock images to a background image. The user can select background image, set time format, set clock time by command parameters. The user can also change the color, size, and position of the clock image by modified the program source code. This test program also use *xclRegRead* API to read the value of register *time_val* of *rtc_gen* kernel and use to value to control image display refresh.

<br/>

## How to Use This Repository

Before go through the following steps, don't forget to source XRT and Vitis setup files, for example:

~~~
source /opt/xilinx/xrt/setup.sh
source /opt/xilinx/Vitis/2020.2/settings64.sh
~~~

The two test programs need to display images. So if you are using remote server, please use VNC desktop, or ssh connection with X11 forwarding along with local X11 server.

### Build the hardware

Change to *./hw* directory, then use **make** command to finish the building of three XO files and to XCLBIN files. All available make command option includes:

~~~
make
      Display help information

make all TARGET=<hw/hw_emu> PLATFORM=<FPGA PLATFORM>
      Command to build all the rtc_gen_test and rtc_alpha xclbin and necessary kernel files (xo) for  
      specified target and platform. By default, TARGET=hw, PLATFORM=xilinx_u200_gen3x16_xdma_1_1_202020_1

make all_xo TARGET=<hw/hw_emu> PLATFORM=<FPGA PLATFORM>
      Command to build all the kernel files (xo), including rtc_gen.xo, alpha_mix.xo and strm_dump.xo
      By default, TARGET=hw, PLATFORM=xilinx_u200_gen3x16_xdma_1_1_202020_1

make clean
      Command to remove all the generated files.
~~~

In the make commond options, the TARGET can be *hw* or *hw_emu*. Because the *rtc_gen* kernel doesn't provide software emulation model, so *sw_emu* mode cannot be used. When the TARGET is *hw*, the XCLBIN and XO files will be with *_hw* postfix; when the TARGET is *hw_emu*, the XCLBIN and XO files will be with *_hw_emu* postfix. Please note the RTL kernel *rtc_gen* will not be affected by the *hw* or *hw_emu* option, and there will only be a XO file *rtc_gen.xo*.

The PLATFORM could be one of the six choices: xilinx_u200_gen3x16_xdma_1_1_202020_1, xilinx_u200_xdma_201830_2, xilinx_u250_gen3x16_xdma_3_1_202020_1, xilinx_u250_xdma_201830_2, xilinx_u50_gen3x16_xdma_201920_3 and xilinx_u280_xdma_201920_3. No matter whether you have these Alveo cards installed, you can use the platform as the build PLATFORM if you have installed the development platform package (deb or rpm packages) on your system. You can look into */opt/xilinx/platform* directory or use command *platforminfo -l* to check which platforms have been installed. The finally generated xclbin and xo files will be in *./hw* directory after the successful execution of the make command. 

For example, if you would like to build all XO and XCLBIN files in hardware emulation mode with U50 card, just input:

~~~
make all TARGET=hw_emu PLATFORM=xilinx_u50_gen3x16_xdma_201920_3
~~~

Because the XCLBIN file building for hardware target needs a long time, to save your time, we also provide the pre-built XCLBIN files (*rtc_gen_test_hw.xclbin* and *rtc_alpha_hw.xclbin*) for each kind of supported Alveo platforms. Please note they are built with *TARGET=hw* option and cannot be used in *hw_emu* mode. For *hw_emu* target XCLBIN files, it's much faster to build and system dependent, so please build them by yourself. 

You can download the pre-built XCLBIN files via the link: <https://www.xilinx.com/bin/public/openDownload?filename=rtl_stream_kernel_xclbin_2020.2.tgz>

**To use the pre-built xclbin files, please copy the two xclbin files corresponding to your target platform into *./hw* directory, which will be used directly in downstream steps.**

### Build and run the software

* Step 1: generate Makefile

Change to *./sw/build* directory, then enter **cmake ..** or **cmake3 ..** command. This will generate the *Makefile* for software builds, as well as link the two XCLBIN files in *./hw* directory to *./sw/build* directory.

~~~
cd ./sw/build
cmake ..
~~~

* Step 2: compile the programs

Enter **make** command, then the two C++ program will be compiled. This will generate two executables: *rtc_gen_test* and *rtc_alpha_tb*.

~~~
make
~~~

Please note because XRT low level API *xclRegRead* is used in the test program, so there are different link library sets for the hardware mode and hardware emulation mode. Altogether four executables will be generated after the successful compilation: *rtc_alpha_tb*, *rtc_alpha_tb_emu*, *rtc_gen_test*, *rtc_gen_test_emu*. Please use the correct executables for hardware or hardware emulation modes.

* Step 3: configure running mode (hardware or hardware emulation)

Script *set_emu.sh* is provided to set the running mode.

**Run in hardware mode**

If you didn't enter emulation mode before, just run the executables *rtc_gen_test* and *rtc_alpha_ab* to run in hardware mode. If you have entered hardware emulation mode and want to exit to real hardware mode, just use following command before running the exeutables:

~~~
source setup_emu.sh -s off
~~~

**Run in hardware emulation mode**

To try the test programs in hardware emulation mode, you should use the executables *rtc_gen_test_emu* and *rtc_alpha_tb_emu*. Before running them, please run following command firstly：

~~~
source set_emu.sh -s on -p PLATFORM_NAME
~~~

The *PLATFORM_NAME* is one of the six supported platform, you could run following command to get help information:

~~~
source set_emu.sh
~~~

For example, if you want to run the executable in hardware emulation mode with U50 platform, just input:

~~~
source setup_emu.sh -s on -p xilinx_u50_gen3x16_xdma_201920_3
~~~

*setup_emu.sh* will generate necessary configuration file and setting up the environment. 

**Note:** The *PLATFORM_NAME* you input here should be consistant with the XCLBIN files in *./sw/build* directory.

For more detailes on the hardware emulation for this example design, please read [Emulation Turotial](./doc/hw_emu_tutorial.md)

* Step 4: run executables **rtc_gen_test** or **rtc_gen_test_emu**

Run the executable *rtc_gen_test* or *rtc_gen_test_emu* to finish the program running in hardware or hardware emulation mode. Firstly an eight-digit clock will be displayed, keep the image window front and press *ESC* key, a second eleven-digit clock will be displayed. Keep the image window front then Press *ESC* key again to exit the program. It will also read and print out the value of register *time_val* of the kernel. **Don't forget to set running mode to hardware emulation before running *rtc_gen_test_emu*.**

~~~
./rtc_gen_test

or

./rtc_gen_test_emu
~~~

The program will firstly judge the running mode (hw or hw_emu), then look for *./sw/build/rtc_gen_test_hw.xclbin* or *./sw/build/rtc_gen_test_hw_emu.xclbin* file and analyze it to get the platform it is using, then compare it with the card you have installed. If mismatching is detected, error information will be reported and the program will exit.

**Note**: running under hardware emulation mode may take a long time since it is actually running RTL simulation.

* Step 5: run executables **rtc_alpha_tb** or **rtc_alpha_tb_emu**

Run the executable *rtc_alpha_tb* or *rtc_alpha_tb_emu* to finish the program running in hardware or hardware emulation mode. There are a few command parameters for the executable, the usage is as below:

~~~
rtc_alpha_tb [-i BACK_IMAGE] [-f] [-s] [-h]

  -i BACK_IMAGE: set path to the background image, default is ../media/alveo.jpg
  -f : set to use eleven-digit clock, default is eight-digit
  -s : use system time to set the clock, default don't set the clock
  -h : print help information

~~~

There are three images provided in *./sw/media* directory: alveo.jpg, vitis.jpg and victor.jpg, and you could also use other images. Please note the images should be in three-channel format (RGB without transparency). Also please use images big enough, otherwise please modify the program source code to adjust the clock image size or position. 

Following is some execution command line examples:

~~~
rtc_alpha_tb
      Mix the clock image with ../media/alveo.jpg and display, don't sync the kernel internal real-time-clock 
      with Linux system clock, and use 8-digit format.

rtc_alpha_tb -i ../media/vitis.jpg -f -s
      Mix the clock image with ../media/vitis.jpg and display, sync the kernel internal real-time-clock with
      Linux system clock, and use 11-digit format.
~~~

To exit the program, just keep the image window front, then press **ESC** key.

The program will firstly judge the running mode (hw or hw_emu), then look for *./sw/build/rtc_alpha_hw.xclbin* or *./sw/build/rtc_alpha_hw_emu.xclbin* file and analyze it to get the platform it is using, then compare it with the card you have installed. If mismatching is detected, error information will be reported and the program will exit.

You could make modification to following *#define* section at the beginning of *./sw/src/rtc_alpha_tb.cpp* file to adjust the color, size, position and opacity of the clock image, then repeat **step 2** to re-compile the program and run to see the result. Don't forget to ensure that the width of background image and resized clock image are integer multiples of 8.

~~~c++
// position of clock image, top-left corner is (0,0)
#define RTC_POSITION_ROW 64
#define RTC_POSITION_COL 400

// resized clock image size for 8-digit font digit size
// ensure RTC_IMG_WIDTH is integer multiple of 8
#define RTC_IMG_WIDTH_8D 480
#define RTC_IMG_HEIGHT_8D 90

// resized clock image size for 11-digit font digit size
// ensure RTC_IMG_WIDTH is integer multiple of 8
#define RTC_IMG_WIDTH_11D 528
#define RTC_IMG_HEIGHT_11D 72

// clock image font color
#define FONT_COLOR_R 255
#define FONT_COLOR_G 255
#define FONT_COLOR_B 255

// clock image background color
#define BGR_COLOR_R 80
#define BGR_COLOR_G 80
#define BGR_COLOR_B 80

// clock image background opacity
