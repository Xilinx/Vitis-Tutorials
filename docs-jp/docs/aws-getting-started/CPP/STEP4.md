# Practice and Experiment with C/OpenCL Kernels

Apply and practice what you've learned in the earlier steps of this guide by running more hands-on examples. Familiarize yourself with online resources relating to the SDAccel™ environment, and make your way to the [AWS forum](https://forums.aws.amazon.com/forum.jspa?forumID=243) to search for knowledge and find answers.

## Experiment with Other Examples

Running and experimenting with these three examples of the C/OpenCL™ kernels allows you to further familiarize yourself with good coding practices and kernel optimization techniques.

### Loop Pipelining
This example demonstrates how loop pipelining can be used to improve the performance of a kernel.
