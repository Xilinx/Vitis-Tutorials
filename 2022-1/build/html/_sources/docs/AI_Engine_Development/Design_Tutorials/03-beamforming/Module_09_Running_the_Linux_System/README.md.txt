# Building the Design

The next step is to package the Linux system and run it on the VCK190 board. To package the Linux system for hardware with a single command, run the following command:

```
make all
```

## Running the System

For the hardware build, the ``–-package`` command creates an ``sd_card.img`` file which contains the contents of the ``sd_card/`` folder. Copy the ``sd_card.img`` file onto an SD card. This will become the boot device of your system. Perform the following steps to run the `test_bf_app.exe` executable on the VCK190 board.

1. Ensure your board is powered off.
2. Use an SD card writer (such as balenaEtcher) to flash the `sd_card.img` file to an SD card.
3. Plug the flashed SD card into the top slot of the VCK190 board.
4. Set the switch SW1 Mode\[3:0\]=1110 = OFF OFF OFF ON
5. Connect your computer to the VCK190 board using the included USB cable.
6. Open a TeraTerm terminal and select the correct COM port. Set the port settings to the following:

```
Port: <COMMXX>
Speed: 115200
Data: 8 bit
Parity: none
Stop Bits: 1 bit
Flow control: none
Transmit delay: 0 msec/char 0 msec/line
```

7. Power on the board.
8. Wait until you see the `root@versal-rootfs-common-2021_1` Linux command prompt. Press enter a few times to get past any `xinit` errors.
9. Run the following commands into the TeraTerm terminal:

```
cd /mnt/sd-mmcblk0p1
export XILINX_XRT=/usr
./test_bf_app.exe 0 aie.xclbin
```
The `test_bf_app.exe` should execute functional and performance tests. At the end of the application, you should see the following final output:

```
[ULBF] Read first 4 iterations of Slave-11 errCount:0...
[DLBF+ULBF] - ***** TEST PASSED *****
 ***** END TEST *****
```
