# Beamforming Tutorial

***Version: Vitis 2021.2***

## Introduction

The Versal® adaptive compute acceleration platform (ACAP) is a fully software programmable, heterogeneous compute platform that combines the processing system (PS) (Scalar Engines that include Arm™ processors), programmable logic (PL) (Adaptable Engines that include the programmable logic), and AI Engines which belong in the Intelligent Engine category.

This tutorial demonstrates the creation of a beamforming system running on the AI Engine, PL, and PS, and the validation of the design running on this heterogeneous domain.

The tutorial has been divided into modules. It takes you through creating a custom embedded platform, a bare-metal host application, and a custom PetaLinux-based Linux host application, as well as hardware emulation and hardware build flows in the context of a complete Versal ACAP system integration. Each module uses a Makefile to build the relevant aspect of the design.

### Tutorial Overview

This beamforming tutorial is a system-level design that uses the AI Engine, PL, and PS resources. This design showcases the following features:

* A high utilization of PL and AI Engine resources which require advanced timing closure techniques
* Custom platform creation
* An AI Engine graph that implements matrix multiplication functions for uplink and downlink beamforming
* RTL kernels that interface with the AI Engine and operate at 400 MHz
* A scalable architecture that only needs a small number of kernels to be developed and can be copied multiple times to extend compute power
* Bare-metal and PetaLinux PS host application development process
* Timing closure methods for a high utilization design
* Hardware emulation and VCK190 board flows
* A hierarchical Makefile structure to highlight dependencies between build steps and showcase a way for multiple developers to work on the same repository at the same time (AI Engine developers, RTL designers, and software developers)

#### Assumptions

To fully grasp the design, it is assumed that you have the following knowledge and resources:

* Ability to read Tcl scripts
* Ability to read C++ based source code to understand the AI Engine kernels and host application source code (bare metal and Linux)
* Ability to read Verilog RTL to understand the Vivado® projects created for the RTL PL kernels
* A base bootable design (that is to say, you have brought up your board, and have a working hardware and board through a simple Vivado design)

## Before You Begin

This tutorial targets the [VCK190 ES board](https://www.xilinx.com/products/boards-and-kits/vck190.html). This board is currently available through early access. If you have already purchased this board, download the necessary files from the lounge and ensure you have the correct licenses installed. If you do not have a board and ES license, get in touch with your Xilinx sales contact.

```
2. Source the environment script:

```bash
source env_setup.sh
```  

### *Validation*: Confirming Tool Installation

Make sure you are using the 2021.2 version of the Xilinx tools.

```bash

### System Design Overview

This tutorial showcases a beamforming system with 32 layers and 64 antennas implemented on an XCVC1902 Versal ACAP device in the VCK190 board. The beamforming system consists of a downlink subsystem which contains the DL64A32L AI Engine subgraph and the ``dlbf_data``, ``dlbf_coeff``, and ``dlbf_slave`` PL RTL kernels. The beamforming system also consists of the uplink subsystem, which contains the UL64A32L AI Engine subgraph and the ``ulbf_data``, ``ulbf_coeff``, and ``ulbf_slave`` PL RTL kernels. Together, the downlink and uplink subsystems implement the uplink and downlink matrix multiplication equations for M=32 layers and N=64 antennas and compute sample data. The results are compared to reference downlink and uplink result data for verification. The entire beamforming system is copied three times to make full use of the available AI Engine and PL resources.

### Beamforming Introduction

This tutorial shows efficient implementation of beamforming functionality on AI Engine arrays in the Xilinx Versal AI Engine devices. The design methodology is applicable to many use cases needing high throughput matrix multiplication, such as 5G wireless communication. The following figure shows an example illustration of how matrix multiplication is used in the beamforming of an orthogonal frequency division multiplex (OFDM) system with four layers and six antennas.

![Beamforming General Image](images/Beamforming_introduction.png)

#### Downlink Beamforming

A single symbol of an OFDM system contains a frequency component and time component allocated to a single user (X<sub>0,0</sub>). Multiple symbols in different layers of an OFDM system (X<sub>0,0</sub>,X<sub>0,1</sub>,X<sub>0,2</sub>,X<sub>0,3</sub>) are multiplied by a specific set of complex weights (H<sub>0,0</sub>,H<sub>1,0</sub>,H<sub>2,0</sub>,H<sub>3,0</sub>) so the data between layers becomes “orthogonal” to each other. This orthogonality allows the layers to be summed together into a single signal (Y<sub>0,0</sub>) which is sent to an antenna. A second antenna signal (X<sub>0,1</sub>) can be created by multiplying another set of weights (H<sub>0,1</sub>,H<sub>1,1</sub>,H<sub>2,1</sub>,H<sub>3,1</sub>) to each layer (X<sub>0,0</sub>,X<sub>0,1</sub>,X<sub>0,2</sub>,X<sub>0,3</sub>). The same is done to create the rest of the antenna signals (Y<sub>0,2</sub>,Y<sub>0,3</sub>,Y<sub>0,4</sub>, and Y<sub>0,5</sub>).

##### Downlink Beamforming Formulation

The example and generalized downlink matrix multiplication formulas are given below.

###### Generalized Downlink Beamforming Equations

![Downlink Generalized Formulas](images/downlink_generalized_formulas.PNG)

#### Uplink Beamforming

At the receiving end, the antenna data (Y<sub>0,0</sub>-Y<sub>0,5</sub>) can be demultiplexed back into their original layers (X<sub>0,0</sub>-Y<sub>0,3</sub>) because of their orthogonal feature.
