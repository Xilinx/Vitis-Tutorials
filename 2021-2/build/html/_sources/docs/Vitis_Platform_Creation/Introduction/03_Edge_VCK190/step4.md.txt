## Step 4: Test the Platform

### Test 1: Read Platform Info

With Vitis environment setup, **platforminfo** tool can report XPFM platform information.

We can verify hardware configuration (clocks, memory) and software configuration (domain) are set as expected.

### Test 2: Run a PL acceleration application

To verify the platform functionality, we will create an acceleation project with PL kernel. We will use Vitis built-in Vector Addition template to do this test.

1. Launch Vitis

   ```
   mkdir -p ref_files/step4_verify
   cd ref_files/step4_verify
   vitis -workspace ./ &
   ```
   
   Close the welcome tab after Vitis launches.

2. Add custom platform

   - Select menu **Xilinx -> Add custom platform...**
   - Click **add** button
   - Select the directory that [step3](./step3.md) generates. For example `ref_files/step3_pfm/platform_repo`
   - Click **OK**

3. Create vector addition application on the custom platform

   - Select menu **File -> New -> Application Project**.
   - Go through the welcome page and click **Next**.
   - On Platform page, select **vck190_custom** platform in the platform list. Click **Next**.

   - Set **Application project name** to **vadd**, target processor **psv_cortexa72_SMP**. Click **Next**.
   
     ![](./images/step4/vitis_create_vadd.png)

   - Input **Sysroot** path (step3_pfm/sw_comp/sysroots/aarch64-xilinx-linux), **RootFS** path (step3_pfm/sw_comp/rootfs.ext4) and **Kernel Image** path (step3_pfm/sw_comp/Image). These components were prepared in [step 3](./step3.md). Click **Next**. 

      ![](./images/step4/vitis_create_vadd_swcomp.png)

   - Select template **Vector Addition**. Click **Finish**.

4. Build the vector addition application for hardware

   - Select **vadd_system** project
   - Click the drop down of **Build** hammer icon on tool bar, select **Hardware**. Alternatively, this step can be done by selecting **Active Build Configuration** to **Hardware** and click the build icon.
   - It takes some time to build hardware. Finally Vitis will generate **sd_card.img** in vadd_system/Hardware/package directory.


5. (Optional) Build the vector addition application for hardware emulation

   - Select **vadd_system** project
   - Click the drop down of **Build** hammer icon on tool bar, select **Emulation-HW**. Alternatively, this step can be done by selecting **Active Build Configuration** to **Emulation HW** and click the build icon.
   - If it pops-up a dialogue to ask whether to clean the project, select **Don't clean**.


#### Test the Application on Hardware

1. Copy `vadd_system/Hardware/package/sd_card.img` to local if you build the project on a remote server or virtual machine.

2. Program sd_card.img to SD card. Refer to [AR#73711](https://www.xilinx.com/support/answers/73711.html) for detailed steps.

   > Note: The programmed SD card has two partitions. FAT32 partition with boot components; EXT4 partition with Linux root file system. Windows system by default cannot see the contents of EXT4 partition.

   > Note: Please eject the SD card properly from the system after programming it.

3. Insert the SD card and boot the VCK190 board with SD boot mode (SW1[4:1] = "1110": OFF, OFF, OFF, ON) and power on.

   > Note: Refer to [VCK190 Evaluation Board User Guide](https://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/boards_and_kits/vck190/ug1366-vck190-eval-bd.pdf) for details about boot mode.

4. Connect to UART console

5. Launch the test application from UART console

   ```
   cd /mnt/sd-mmcblk0p1
   ./vadd binary_container_1.xclbin
   ```

   > Note: Depends on the device tree version, the mount point of the SD card could be /mnt/sd-mmcblk1p1. Please try this path if /mnt/sd-mmcblk0p1 is not available on your system.

6. Expected print on UART console

   **Note**: the `[   35.116279] [drm]` messages are print from XRT for debugging purpose. It only shows up on UART. It will now print on ssh. This debugging message can be turned off by turning down the system dmesg reporting level.

   ```
   echo "4" > /proc/sys/kernel/printk
   ```

#### (Optional) Test the Application on Hardware Emulation
1. Launch Emulator for PS

   - Click menu **Xilinx -> Start/Stop Emulator**
   - Select Project: **vadd_system**, Configuration: **Emulation-HW**

   ![Launch Emulator for Vadd Project](images/step4/vitis_emulation_vadd.png)
 
   - Click **Start**
   - There will be prints on Emulation Console. 
   - Wait for it to boot Linux. The wait window will disappear after it detects Linux boot successfully.

2. Launch PL emulation

   - Right click **vadd_system**, select **Run as -> Run Configurations**
   - Select **vadd_system-Default**
   - Change **Build Configuration** to **Emulation-HW**
   - Click Run
   - Check run result

   ![Vitis Emulation Vadd Result](images/step4/vitis_emulation_vadd_result.png)

3. Stop the Emulator

   - Click menu **Xilinx -> Start/Stop Emulator**
   - Click **Stop** button

**What Just Happened?**

Vitis runs PS emulation in QEMU, PL and AIE emulation in XSIM. They can communicate with each other. When running the emulation, Vitis downloads executable and xclbin to Remote Working Directory and launch it.

### Test 3: Run an AIE + PL acceleration application project

To verify the platform functionality, we will create a project with AIE + PL kernel and PS application and run it on VCK190 board.

1. Create vector addition application on the custom platform

   - Select menu **File -> New -> Application Project**.
   - Go through the welcome page and click **Next**.
   - On Platform page, select **vck190_custom** platform in the platform list. Click **Next**.
   - Set application name **plaie**, target processor **psv_cortexa72_SMP**. Click **Next**.
   - Input Sysroot path, RootFS path and Kernel Image. Click **Next**.
   - Select template **AI Engine System Design Examples -> AI Engine, PL and PS System Design**. Click **Finish**.

2. Build the vector addition application for hardware

   - Select **plaie_system** project
   - Click the drop down of **Build** hammer icon on tool bar, select **Hardware**. Alternatively, this step can be done by selecting **Active Build Configuration** to **Hardware** and click build icon.

3. (Optional) Build the vector addition application for hardware emulation

   - Select **plaie_system** project
   - Click the drop down of **Build** hammer icon on tool bar, select **Emulation-HW**. Alternatively, this step can be done by selecting **Active Build Configuration** to **Emulation HW** and click build icon.
   - If it pops-up a dialogue to ask whether to clean the project, select **Don't clean**.

4. After a successful build, **sd_card.img** is generated in `plaie_system/Hardware/package` and `plaie_system/Hardware/package_no_aie_debug` directory. They include all files in sd_card directory in the first FAT32 partition and contents of rootfs.ext4 in second EXT4 partition. The differences are the **sd_card.img** in **package** directory has a package parameter `enable_aie_debug=1`. It's used for debugging. The one in **package_no_aie_debug** can work for free running.



#### Test the Application on Hardware

1. Copy the **sd_card.img** from `plaie_system/Hardware/package_no_aie_debug` directory to local, if the project is run on a server or virtual machine.

   > Note: Vitis will generate images with aie_debug enabled and disabled. The image with aie_debug disabled will run freely; The image with aie_debug enabled will halt AI Engine and wait for the debugger to connect to it.

2. Program **sd_card.img** to the SD card. Refer to [AR#73711](https://www.xilinx.com/support/answers/73711.html) for detailed steps.

   > Note: The programmed SD card has two partitions. FAT32 partition with boot components; EXT4 partition with Linux root file system. Windows system by default cannot see the contents of EXT4 partition.

   > Note: Please eject the SD card properly from the system after programming it.

3. Insert the SD card and boot the VCK190 board with SD boot mode (SW1[4:1] = "1110": OFF, OFF, OFF, ON) and power on.

   > Note: Refer to [VCK190 Evaluation Board User Guide](https://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/boards_and_kits/vck190/ug1366-vck190-eval-bd.pdf) for details about boot mode.

4. Setup XRT runtime environment and launch test application from UART console

   ```
   cd /mnt/sd-mmcblk0p1
   ./plaie binary_container_1.xclbin
   ```

5. Expected print on UART console
