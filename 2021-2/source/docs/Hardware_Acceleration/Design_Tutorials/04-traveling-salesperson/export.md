We look at the export phase of the flow to packages the RTL either the Vivado or the Vitis flow.
In addition,  we run the Vivado tool directly from the Vitis HLS GUI to get more accurate timing and resource estimates.


## Export the accelerated function and evaluate in Vivado

During the export phase of the flow, Vitis HLS packages the results into a form that can be consumed by either Vitis or Vivado.  

- Change the number of cities back to 13 in `tsp.h`
- Run C synthesis
- Export through the toolbar "play" pulldown menu or via the main menu: `Solution` -> `Run Implementation`
- In the dialog, select `RTL synthesis, Place and Route` as shown below:  

![export dialog](./images/run_implementation.png)

- Click OK and let Vivado synthesis and implementation run until the flow completes, and updates the main screen of Vitis HLS.
## Review the Vivado results
