Vitis provides a unified flow for developing FPGA accelerated application targeted to either data-center or embedded platforms. This tutorial provides instructions for building and running on both ZCU102 and Alveo U200 cards. These instructions can be easily adapted to other Xilinx cards.

.. note::
   This tutorial requires Vitis 2020.2 or later to run.
