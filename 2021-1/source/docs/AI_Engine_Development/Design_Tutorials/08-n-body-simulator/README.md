## Goals of this Tutorial 
### HPC Applications
The goal of this tutorial is to create a general-purpose floating point accelerator for HPC applications. This tutorial demonstrates a x24,800 performance improvement using the AI Engine accelerator over the naive C++ implementation on the A72 embedded Arm® processor. 

#### A similar accelerator example was implemented on the UltraScale+™-based Ultra96 device using only PL resources [here](https://www.hackster.io/rajeev-patwari-ultra96-2019/ultra96-fpga-accelerated-parallel-n-particle-gravity-sim-87f45e).


|Name|Hardware|Algorithm Complexity|Average Execution Time to Simulate 12,800 Particles for 1 Timestep (seconds)|
|---|---|--|---|
|Python N-Body Simulator|x86 Linux Machine|O(N)|14.96|
|C++ N-Body Simulator|A72 Embedded Arm Processor|O(N<sup>2</sup>)|124.79|
|AI Engine N-Body SImulator|Versal AI Engine IP|O(N)|0.004657468|

### PL Data-Mover Kernels
Another goal of this tutorial is to showcase how to generate PL Data-Mover kernels from the [Vitis Utility Library](https://xilinx.github.io/Vitis_Libraries/utils/2021.1/datamover/kernel_gen_guide.html). These kernels moves any amount of data from DDR buffers to AXI-Streams.  

## The N-Body Problem
The N-Body problem is the problem of predicting the motions of a group of N objects which each have a gravitational force on each other. For any particle `i` in the system, the summation of the gravitational forces from all the other particles results in the acceleration of particle `i`. From this acceleration, we can calculate a particle's velocity and position (`x y z vx vy vz`) will be in the next timestep. Newtonian physics describes the behavior of very large bodies/particles within our universe. With certain assumptions, the laws can be applied to bodies/particles ranging from astronomical size to a golf ball (and even smaller). 

#### 12,800 Particles simulated on a 400 tile AI Engine accelerator for 300 timesteps

The colormap simulates the Red Shift effect in astronomy. When the particles are red, they are farther away in space (`-z` direction). When the particles are blue, they are closer to you in space (`+z` direction). 

### Newton's Second Law of Motion
Newton's Second Law motion in mathmatical form states the force on body i equals its mass times acceleration. 

![alt text](images/newtons_second_law_eq.PNG) 

### Gravity Equations - Two Bodies 
When the force on body i is caused by its gravitational attraction to body j, that force is calculated by the following gravity equation: 

![alt text](images/bodys_equation.PNG)

Where G is the gravitational constant, and r is the distance between body i and body j. Combining Newton's second law motion with the gravity equation gives the following equation for calculating the acceleration of body i due to body j. 

![alt text](images/acc_equation_2_bodies.PNG)

We multiply by the unit vector of r to maintain the direction of the force. 

If given an initial velocity (v<sub>t</sub>) and position (x<sub>t</sub>), we can calculate our particle's new position, acceleration, and velocity in the next timestep (t+1). 

* Position Equation: x<sub>t+1</sub>=x<sub>t</sub>+v\*ts
* Aceleration Equation: (from above) 
* Velocity Equation: v<sub>t+1</sub>=v<sub>t</sub>+a\*ts

### Gravity Equations - N Bodies
Our NBody simulator will extends the above gravity equation to calcuate positions, accelerations, and velocities in the x, y, and z directions of N bodies in a system. 
For the sake of simplicity in implementation, the following assumptions were made:

1. All particles are point masses
2. Gravitational constant G=1
3. We use a softening factor (sf<sup>2</sup>=1000) in gravity equations to avoid errors when two point masses are at exactly same co-ordinates.
4. The timestep constant ts=1

The N-Body Simulator will implement the following gravity equations. 

Given inital positions and velocities `x y z vx vy vz` at timestep `t`, we can calculate the new positions `x y z` of the next timestep `t+1`: 
![alt text](images/position_equations.PNG)

To calculate the acceleration in the x, y, and z directions of any particle `i` (`accxi accyi acczi`), you must sum the acceleration caused by all other particles in the system (particles `j`): 
![alt text](images/gravity_acc_equations.PNG)

When you have your accelerations, calculate the new velocities in the x, y, and z directions: 
![alt text](images/velocity_equations_2.PNG) 

Using these gravity equations, you can calculate your particles' new positions and velocities `x y z vx vy vz` at timestep `t+1` and repeat the calculations for the next timestep after. If there are a large number of particles in the system and/or you are simulating for a large number of timesteps, you will quickly see the compute intensive nature of this problem. This algorithm has a computational complexity of *O(N<sup>2</sup>)* due to the iterative nature of the process. This is a great opportunity for implementing an accelerator in hardware. 

In Module_01-Python Simulations on x86, you can try the `nbody.py` to see how slow the particle simulation runs in software only. The particle simulation will run much faster with accelerators implemented in hardware (AI Engine).

This algorithm can be vectorized, hence reducing the complexity to O(N). In our AI Engine design, we will breakdown our workload to parallelize the computation on 100 AI Engine compute units.

### System Design Overview
The N-Body Simulator is implemented on an `XCVC1902 Versal ACAP` device on the VCK190 board. It consists of PL HLS datamover kernels from the Vitis Utility Library (`m2s_x2` and `s2m_x4`), custom HLS kernels that enable packet switching (`packet_sender` and `packet_receiver`), and a 400 tile AI Engine design. Additionaly, the design consists of host applications that enable the entire design, verify the data coming out of the AI Engine, and run the design for multiple timesteps. 

![alt text](images/System_diagram.PNG)

#### Dataflow 
* The host applications store input data (`i` and `j`) in global memory (DDR) and turn on the PL HLS kernels (running at 300 MHz) and the AI Engine graph (running at 1GHz). 
* Data moves from DDR to the dual-channel HLS datamover kernel `m2s_x2`. The `i` data goes into one channel and the `j` data goes into the other channel. Here, data movement switches from AXI-MM to AXI-Stream. The read/write bandwith of DDR is set to the default 0.04 Gbps.
* The AI Engine graph performs packet switching on the `input_i` data, so the `i` data needs to be packaged appropriately before being sent to the AI Engine. So from the `m2s_x2` kernel, it is streamed to the HLS `packet_sender` kernel. The `packet_sender` kernel sends a packet header and appropriately asserts `TLAST` before sending packets of `i` data to the 100 `input_i` ports in the AI Engine. 
* The AI Engine graph expects the `j` data to be streamed directly into the AI Engine kernels, so no additional packaging is needed. The `j` data is directly streamed from the `m2s_x2` kernel into the AI Engine.  
* The AI Engine distributes the gravity equation computations onto 100 accelerators (each using 4 AI Engine tiles). The AI Engine graph outputs new `i` data through the 100 `output_i` ports. The `output_i` data is also packet switched and needs to be appropriately managed by the `packet_receiver`. 
* The `packet_receiever` kernel receives a packet and evaluates the header as 0, 1, 2, or 3 and appropriately sends the `output_i` data to the `k0`, `k1`, `k2`, or `k3` streams.
* The `s2m_x4` quad-channel HLS datamover kernel receives the `output_i` data and writes it to global memory (DDR). Here, data movement switches from AXI-Stream to AXI-MM. 
* Then, depending on the host application, the new output data is read and compared against the golden expected data or saved as the next iteration of `i` data and the AI Engine N-Body Simulator runs for another timestep. 

*Note:* The entire design is a compute-bound problem, meaning we are limited to how fast the AI Engine tiles compute the floating-point gravity equations. This is not a memory-bound design.

## Build Flows 
This tutorial has two build flows you can choose from depending on your comfort level with Xilinx design processes.  

### For more advanced users
For those who are already familiar with the creating AI Engine designs and Vitis projects, you may just want to build the entire design with a single command. You can do this by running the following command from the top-level folder: 

*Estimated Time: 6 hours*

```
make all
```

### For more novice users

For those who are just starting out, you may want to build each module one at time, view the output on the terminal, and learn as you work your way through the tutorial. In this case, cd into each Module folder and run the `make all` command to build just that component of the design. The specific commands `make all` runs under the hood is specificed in each Module's README.md. 

*Estimated Time: depends on the Module you're building*

```
cd Module_0*
make all
```

### A Word about Makefiles

This design is built with the help of Makefiles. Each module can be run from the top-level Makefile or from the Makefile inside each module. You can quickly see which make commands are available by running the `make help` command. You can also use the `make clean` command to remove the generated files.  

### Building for VCK190 ES1 Board

By default, the Makefiles build the design for the VCK190 Production board (i.e. using the xilinx_vck190_base_202110_1 embedded platform). In order to build the design for the VCK190 ES1 board, ensure you've downloaded the xilinx_vck190_es1_base_202110_1 embedded platform from the lounge, so its available for this design build. Then specify the command-line input `PLATFORM=xilinx_vck190_es1_base_202110_1` with your make commands. For example,  
```
make all PLATFORM=xilinx_vck190_es1_base_202110_1
```
