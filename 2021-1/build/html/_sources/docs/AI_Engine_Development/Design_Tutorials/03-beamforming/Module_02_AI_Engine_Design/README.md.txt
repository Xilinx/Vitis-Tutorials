## Introduction

### AI Engine Kernels, Graphs, and Applications

AI Engine kernels are computation functions that work together to build data flow graphs. Multiple subgraphs can be stitched together into larger high-level graphs. This beamforming tutorial uses three beamforming kernels that implement matrix multiplication functions. These kernels are strung together to form the downlink and uplink subgraphs. Three uplink and three downlink subgraphs are instantiated in a high-level data flow graph `TEST_BF` defined in `test_bf.h`. The AI Engine application contains an instance of the `TEST_BF` graph and can be compiled and simulated using the AI Engine tool chain.

## AI Engine Kernels and Graphs

The fundamental beamforming kernel computes a complex matrix multiplication on a (8x8) coefficient matrix times a (8x1) input data matrix which results in a (8x1) output data matrix. The beamforming kernel repeats the matrix multiplication computation on as many (8x1) input data matrices as are fed into it.

When the beamforming kernel computes the matrix multiplication, the results are only partial summations. The beamforming kernel then sends the partial results to identical kernels in a cascade chain for further accumulation and multiplication into a final accumulated (8x1) output data matrix. A real 5G system is determined by the number of layers (M) and number of antennas (N). For this beamforming tutorial, M is determined by the number of inputs into the chain (that is, the length of the input data matrix (8) times the number of kernels in a cascade chain). N is determined by the number of final accumulated outputs at the end of the chain (8) times the number of chains in your design.    

This beamforming kernel comes in three flavors: `bf8x8_fst`, `bf8x8_mid`, and `bf8x8_lst`. Review the source files defined in the `src/kernels/` folder.

![Beamforming Kernels](images/beamforming_kernels.PNG)

The kernels are strung together into a cascading chain, and they are named first, middle, and last depending on their location in the cascading chain. All three of these kernels implement the matrix multiplication function and only differ in the input and output interfaces. The first kernel in the cascading chain does not have a cascading input because it is the first kernel in a chain. The middle kernel has both a cascading input and a cascading output. The last kernel has both a cascading input and output, but writes the output to local memory instead of the cascading bus. 

All three beamforming kernel types start by loading the input data and input coefficient data from PL kernels. The first beamforming kernel computes the matrix multiplication, computes the first partial summation, and sends it to a middle kernel using an output cascade. The middle kernel reads the partial summation from the previous kernel, computes its own matrix multiplication on the accumulated data, and generates its own output cascade. This output cascade becomes the input cascade to either another middle kernel or the last kernel. The last kernel does the final matrix multiplication on the accumulated data and writes the final results to a PL kernel. The entire chain of beamforming kernels repeats these calculations on new input data for 12 subcarriers in total.    

### Cascading Chain Subgraph

The subgraph `bfCascadingChain` is used to create a cascading chain of beamforming kernels. Review the graph definition in the `src/inc/subsys.h`. It is a templated subgraph with parameters `xoff`, `yoff`, and `len`. The `xoff` and `yoff` parameters define the coordinate of the leftmost AI Engine. The `len` parameter specifies the length of the cascading chain (`len-2` = the number of middle kernels in a chain). The port arrays `din[len]` and `cin[len]` are the data input and coefficient input ports. The size of these arrays is determined by the `len` parameter (so, we need one data input port and one coefficient input port for each kernel in the cascade chain). Additionally, there is one output port `out` for the final output in the last kernel. 

You can create subgraphs that contains multiple cascading chains where each chain can be customized to contain any number of beamforming kernels.

### Downlink Subgraph

The subgraph DL64A32L is a 64-antenna-32-layer downlink subgraph. Review the graph definition in the `src/inc/subsys.h`. It consists of eight `bfCascadingChain` subgraphs of length four beamforming kernels. This subgraph has four data input ports and 32 coefficient input ports. All eight chains get the same input data. Each chain gets four of the coefficient input ports each. There are eight output data ports for the output of each chain.

### Uplink Subgraph

The uplink subgraph UL64A32L is the reverse of the downlink subgraph. Review the graph definition in the `src/inc/subsys.h` It consists of four `bfCascadingChain` subgraphs each of the length of eight beamforming kernels. This subgraph has eight data input ports and 32 coefficient input ports. All four chains get the same input data. Each chain gets eight of the coefficient input ports each. There are four output data ports for the output of each chain.  

### Test Beamforming Graph

The test beamforming `TEST_BF` graph is the high-level AI Engine graph that contains three instances of the `DL64A32L` subgraph and three instances of the `UL64A32L` subgraph. Review the graph definition in the `src/test_bf.h`.

## AI Engine Application

Review the `test_bf_3x.cpp` AI Engine application. Note that all the input and output PLIO ports for the `TEST_BF` graph are instantiated. Next, instantiate the virtual platform and connect the virtual platform's `src` and `sink` arrays to PLIOs.

Each input PLIO port has a `*.txt` file relative to the current directory that sources the input platform data. Each output PLIO port specifies a `.*txt` file to sink the output platform data. The beamforming kernels expect `cint16` data inputs, so the input data `*.txt` files are organized as four columns per row where each column represents a 16-bit real or imaginary value.

Lastly, the AI Engine application uses the Run Time Graph Control API with an infinite graph execution. The graph `dut` is declared from the `TEST_BF` graph class. In the `main` function, this graph object is initialized and run. The `init()` method loads the graph to the AI Engine array at specific AI Engine tiles. This includes loading the ELF binaries for each AI Engine, configuring the stream switching for routing, and configuring the DMAs for I/O. It leaves the processors in a disabled state. The `run()` method starts the graph execution by enabling the processors. This graph runs for one iteration. The run-time event API for performance profiling is used to calculate the throughput of two of the output ports.

## Sending Data to the Beamforming Kernels

AI Engine kernels consume input blocks of data and produce output blocks of data. There are two data access mechanisms kernels can do: window-based access or stream-based access. The beamforming kernels access data with the window-based access mechanism.

### AI Engine Kernels Parameters

The view that a kernel has of incoming blocks of data is called an input window. Input windows are defined by type, to define the type of data contained within that window. The beamforming kernels expect an input window carrying complex integers where both the real and imaginary parts are 16 bits wide for the input data (`x_input`) and input coefficient (`c_input`) parameters.

```
void bf8x8_fst(                                     \
            input_window_cint16 * restrict c_input, \
            input_window_cint16 * restrict x_input, \
            output_stream_cacc48 * cascadeout       \
            );  
```

The view that a kernel has of outgoing blocks of data is called an output window. The last beamforming kernel (bf8x8_lst) shows a declaration of an output window carrying complex integers where both the real and imaginary parts are 16 bits for the output data (data_out) parameter.

```
void bf8x8_lst(                                     \
            input_window_cint16 * restrict c_input, \
            input_window_cint16 * restrict x_input, \
            input_stream_cacc48 * data_in,          \
            output_window_cint16 * restrict data_out
            );

```
### AI Engine Subgraph Window Connections

The size of the window (in bytes) is declared with the ``connect<window<WINDOOW_SIZE>>`` construct. The ``bfCascadeChain`` data flow graph establishes the window connections between the input and output ports of the graph and the input ports of the beamforming kernels.

```C++
// Make connections for input data and coefficient
for(unsigned i=0;i<len;i++){
  connect<window<IN_COEF_WINSZ>>(cin[i], core[i].in[0]);
  connect<window<IN_DATA_WINSZ>>(din[i], core[i].in[1]);
}

// Connect Output
connect<window<OUT_DATA_WINSZ>>(core[(len-1)*(1-(yoff&1))].out[0], out);
```
The window sizes of the coefficient, data, and output ports are as follows:

|Window Size Name|Window Size (bytes)| Number of 32-bit complex data samples|
|  ---  |  ---  |  ---  |
|IN_DATA_WINSZ | 3072 | 768 |
|IN_COEF_WINSZ | 2048  | 512 |
|OUT_DATA_WINSZ | 3072  | 768 |


### AI Engine Application Data Files

Lastly, you need to send the actual input data to the beamforming kernels and receive the output data from the beamforming kernels. This is accomplished through the PLIOs instantiated in the AI Engine application. Each PLIO specifies a 64-bit PL interface with an associated input or output data file. This means each row in the data files can store two (32-bit) complex data samples. An AI Engine kernel that is expecting a cint16 with a 64-bit PLIO needs a data file organized as four columns per row, where each column represents a 16-bit real or imaginary value.

```
<16-bit real> <16-bit imaginary> <16-bit real> <16-bit imaginary>
```

## Simulating the AI Engine Graph Application

Next, conduct a System C simulation of your AI Engine application using the AI Engine System C Simulator (`aiesimulator`). This simulator can model the AI Engine array, global memory (DDR memory), and network-on-chip (NoC). Invoke the AI Engine System C simulator with the following ``make`` command:

```
make sim
```
or
```
cd build;
aiesimulator –pkg-dir Work –output-dir aiesimulator-output |& tee aiesimulator-output/aiesim.log
```
The ``aiesimulator`` executes the AI Engine application where the AI Engine graph is initialized, run, and terminated by the control thread expressed in the `main` function. By default, the ``dut.run()`` option specifies a graph that runs forever. In our AI Engine application, dut.run(NITER) is specified, where NITER = 1. This runs the graph for one iteration. This means the simulation has the AI Engine receiving “one block” of data samples through the input ports, and the AI Engine outputs “one block” of data samples through the output ports. The block size of the data input, coefficient input, and data output ports is specified by the ``IN_DATA_WINSZ``, ``IN_COEF_WINSZ``, and ``OUT_DATA_WINSZ`` global variables.

### Run-Time Event API for Performance Profiling

Additionally, in the AI Engine application, the `event::start_profiling` and `event::read_profiling` API calls are specified. These calls configure the AI Engine to count the accumulated number of clock cycles. Because we know how much data is coming out of the AI Engine (``OUT_DATA_WINSZ``), and using this API gets us the number of clock cycles its takes to receive all the output data, we can calculate the port throughput (bytes per second). This calculation is done in the AI Engine application and printed to the console during simulation. Note that the longer the data is simulated, the higher the throughput accuracy. Currently the number of iterations is chosen as 20.

Open the `build/aiesim.log` file to view the following throughput calculations for two of the output PLIOs:

```
...
DLBF Output0: Throughput 8.57765e+08 Samples/s, i.e. 3.43106e+09 Bytes/s
ULBF Output0: Throughput 8.6297e+08 Samples/s, i.e. 3.45188e+09 Bytes/s
...
```

## Conclusion

5G NR massive MIMO systems require intensive computation for matrix multiplication. It is shown that three 100 MHz 32-layer-64-antenna 5G NR beamforming systems can be implemented on 192 AI Engines with three kernels with slight differences. The proposed matrix multiplication implementation on AI Engine has a flexible and scalable architecture applicable to a wide range of use cases including but not limited to 5G wireless.
