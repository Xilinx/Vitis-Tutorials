Vitis provides a unified flow for developing FPGA accelerated application targeted to either data-center or embedded platforms. This tutorial provides instructions for building and running on both ZCU102 and Alveo U200 cards. These instructions can be easily adapted to other Xilinx cards.

.. note::
   This tutorial requires Vitis 2020.2 or later to run.

Vitis High-Level Synthesis (HLS) is a key part of the Vitis application acceleration development flow. The tool is responsible for compiling C/C++ and OpenCL code into a kernel for acceleration in the programmable logic (PL) region of Xilinx devices. Thus, it is the tool that compiles the hardware kernels for the Vitis tools by performing high-level synthesis.

.. sidebar:: Generating Vivado IP from C/C++ code

   Vitis HLS can also be used to generate Vivado IP from C/C++ code, but that flow is not the subject of this tutorial. Although similar, there are some significant differences between producing Vitis XO kernels and Vivado RTL IP. However, you can use this tutorial as a general introduction to the Vitis HLS tool.
