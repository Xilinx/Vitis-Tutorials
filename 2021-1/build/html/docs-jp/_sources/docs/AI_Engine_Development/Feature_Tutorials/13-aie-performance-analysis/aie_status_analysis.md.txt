# AI Engine Status Analysis

***Version: Vitis 2022.1***

This tutorial shows you how to output a summary of the AI Engine status for further analysis in Vitis Analyzer. The main methods to output AI Engine status are as follows:

- **Automated and periodic AI Engine status output:** After initial setup in `xrt.ini`, this method requires minimal user intervention, because the tool outputs the status at specified time intervals.

- **Manual output the AI Engine status:** This method requires that you run a command each time you want a status output report.

You can then open the status output in Vitis Analyzer for further analysis.

**Note:** The default working directory in this step is `testcase_nofifo_hang`, unless explicitly stated otherwise.

**Note:** The description here is based on the hardware flow. The methods decribed in this tutorial also apply for the hardware emulation flow.

## Setting Up and Running the Design

1. Change the directory to `testcase_nofifo_hang`. 
2. Modify the host code (`sw/host.cpp`) to call `gr.end();`, which causes the design to hang forever. 
3. Build the hardware package. See the example commands below:

	```
	cd testcase_nofifo_hang
	sed -i 's/gr.end(.*);/gr.end();/' sw/host.cpp
	make package TARGET=hw
	```

4. Boot from the SD card. In Linux, change the working directory to `/run/media/mmcblk0p1`:

	```
	cd /run/media/mmcblk0p1
	```

5. Choose one of the following options to dump the AI Engine status.

## **Option 1: Automated and Periodic AI Engine Status Output**

In the working directory `/run/media/mmcblk0p1`, create the file `xrt.ini`, and put the following contents into it:


	[Debug]
	aie_status=true

You can also specify the interval at which the AI Engine status should be probed and analyzed:

	[Debug]
	aie_status=true
	aie_status_interval_us=10000

Run the application:
	
	./host.exe a.xclbin

After some time, messages such as the following will be printed:

	[XRT] WARNING: Potential deadlock/hang found in AI Engines. Graph : gr
	[XRT] WARNING: Potential stuck cores found in AI Engines. Graph : gr Tile : (25,1) Status 0x1001 : Enable,Stream_Stall_MS0
	[XRT] WARNING: Potential stuck cores found in AI Engines. Graph : gr Tile : (24,1) Status 0x201 : Enable,Lock_Stall_E

**Note:** These messages indicate that the design might be stuck. However, it is your responsibility to determine if it is a true deadlock based on the design. 

Wait for some time. Either kill the application run by hitting **Ctrl+C** or suspend it by hitting **Ctrl+Z**. You will then see that multiple files are generated in the working directory:

* `xrt.run_summary`
* `aie_status_edge.json`
* `aieshim_status_edge.json`
* `summary.csv`

Copy them to the local server for further analysis in Vitis Analyzer. 

### **Analyzing the Automated Status Output**

Open the run summary file with the following command:

		vitis_analyzer xrt.run_summary

In Vitis Analyzer, click **Set AI Engine compile summary** in Summary view. 

![set compile summary](./images/aie_status1.PNG)

In the prompted dialog box, click the **...** button, and select the AI Engine compile summary (such as `./Work/graph.aiecompile_summary`) to set the AI Engine compile summary. 

The graph view is as shown in the following figure.

![graph view](./images/aie_status2.PNG)

**1:** The red arrow from the data input from the PL to the window buffers `buf0` and `buf0d` indicates that the input is trying to write to the buffer, but it cannot.

**2:** Kernel `k[0]` is trying to write to `k[1]`, but has stalled at the output stream port. See the red circle on the kernel instance.

**3:** Kernel `k[1]` is trying to read from buffers `buf1` and `buf1d`, but has stalled. See the red circle on the kernel instance.

**4:** The graph output to the PL is not stalled. 

The Tile Status window also shows the information about the kernel, status, stalled port, and so on. 

![graph view](./images/aie_status3.PNG)


**1:** Tile [25,0] (kernel `aie_dest1`) is in status `Stream Stall - Output Ch 0`, which indicates that the kernel is stalled on writing output stream channel 0. 

**2:** Tile [24,0] (kernel `aie_dest2`) is in status `Lock Stall - East`, which is stalled on port `inm`. 

The Buffers view shows the buffer status of the graph. Click the **Buffers** window to select it, and then select the buffer in the graph to be analyzed.

![graph view](./images/aie_status4.PNG)


The PING-PONG buffers are highlighted in the Buffers window. The Lock Status column shows the buffer lock status. The different statuses are as follows:


- **Acquired for read:** The buffer has been acquired for read by the consumer kernel.

- **Released for read:** The buffer has been released for read by the producer kernel.

- **Acquired for write:** The buffer has been acquired for write by the producer kernel.

- **Released for write:** The buffer has been released for write by the consumer kernel.

In this example, it shows that `buf1` is "Acquired for write" and `buf1d` is "Released for write". It indicates that `buf1` has already been acquired for write by `k[0]`. The `buf1d` buffer is released for write, but not released for read. Consequently, the buffers are not able to be acquired for read by `k[1]`, and `k[1]` is stalled. 

## **Option 2: Manual output the AI Engine status**

In Linux, run the application:
	
	/run/media/mmcblk0p1
	./host.exe a.xclbin

After the design runs for some time, either kill the application run by hitting **Ctrl+C** or suspend it by hitting **Ctrl+Z**. Dump the AI Engine status into a JSON file:

	xbutil examine -r aie -d 0 -f json -o xbutil_status.json
	 
Copy the JSON output to a local server for further analysis in Vitis Analyzer. 

### **Analyzing the Manual Status Output**

1. In Vitis Analyzer, click **File → Import Xbutil JSON Output...**.

2. In the prompted window, set the following options:

	• **Xbutil JSON File**: Select the JSON file that was manually generated with the `xbutil` command. For example, select the file `xbutil_status.json`.

	• **AI Engine Compile Summary**: Select the AI Engine compile summary file. For example, `./Work/graph.aiecompile_summary`.

	• **Run Summary**: The run summary to be written. A default name is provided. The run summary can be used to reload the analysis next time by clicking **File → Open Summary...** or **File → Open Recent → Run Summary**.

The Graph and Array views are shown in Vitis Analyzer. The analysis is similar as **Analyzing the Automated Status Output**.

### Conclusion

After completing this tutorial, you have learned how to output the live status of the AI Engine and how to analyze it in Vitis Analyzer.
