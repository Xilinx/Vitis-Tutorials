# Versal Custom Thin Platform Extensible System
This tutorial describes a Versal VCK190 System Example Design based on a thin custom platform (minimal clocks and AXI exposed to PL) including HLS/RTL kernels and an AI Engine kernel using a full Makefile build-flow for Vivado™/Petalinux/Vitis 2021.1.

## Getting Started
The Versal VCK190 System Example Design full Makefile build-flow builds the whole project in the following order:
```
  1. version_check: Checks if the Vivado, Petalinux, and Vitis version is 2021.1
  2. board_repo:    Downloads the board files for es1 and pre-production from the Xilinx GitHub 
  3. xsa:           Building the thin platform xsa (only pre-synth)
  4. petalinux:     Building Petalinux and sysroot
  5. xpfm:          Building the Vitis Platform
  6. bif:           Copy over necessary petalinux files to the generated software platform (required by the Vitis packager)
  7. ip:            Building Ai Engine graph(s) towards libadf.a and compiling hls/rtl kernels to *.xo
  8. ps_apps:       Building all XRT-based PS applications
  9. vitis:         Linking all kernels in the thin platform and packaging all necessary sd_card files
```
The following diagram explains the build-flow dependencies.

**Notes:**
 - The diagram should be read from right to left.
 - The diagram is for illustration only. The actual build-flow is more sequential.
<img src="./documentation/readme_files/Design_dependencies.svg">

In the `[project-root]` you can start the full build with `make all` after setting up the 2021.1 version of Vivado, Petalinux and Vitis:
  - Everything is in the GitHub repository; no extra files are needed.
  - In the `[project-root]/Makefile`: "export DEVICE_NAME := xcvc1902-vsva2197-2MP-e-S-es1" (for es1 version); **change it to xcvc1902-vsva2197-2MP-e-S (for pre-production version)**.
  - `[project-root]/petalinux/Makefile`: the generated tmp-dir ends up in `/tmp`. 
    - If you want to place it somewhere else you need to add `--tmpdir [your_tmp_dir]` at the end of the `petalinux-create` line in the `[project-root]/petalinux/Makefile`. 
      - Be aware that this may not be located on an NFS-drive! 
  - End result: `[project-root]/package_output/sd_card/*` can be used for FAT-32 sd_card (partition); or `[project-root]/package_output/sd_card.img` can be used.

 - Runs the Vitis linker and packager
 - The output of the Vitis packager ends up in `[project-root]/package_output`
   - `[project-root]/package_output/sd_card.img` or you find all FAT-32 files in `[project-root]/package_output/sd_card/*`
 - All other files can be ignored; they are an output from the Vitis packager and are unused
 - After this step you could open the full blockdesign (platform extended with all kernels) in Vivado for review

## Testing
 1. Copy over the `[project-root]/package_output/sd_card/*` to an sd card or put the `[project-root]/package_output/sd_card.img` on an sd card.
 2. Start-up and boot-up (no password is needed for linux login).
 3. Execute the following after boot-up (it also includes the results):
 ```

## Notes
  - xsa: CIPS settings are added manually; configured in the bd-files.
  - **ALL** kernels use 250MHz clock as default.
  - The example design is fully FAT-32 
    - if you like to use ext4 rootfs instead: 
      - petalinux already generates it.
      - You will need to copy it to the Vitis platform in the `[project-root]/Makefile` in the `bif` section.
      - The `v++ -p` command line in `[project-root]\vitis\Makefile` will need adaptations to be able to use ext4 rootfs instead of FAT-32.
  - Simulations and Emulations are **NOT** included in this Tutorial!

## Design Considerations
  Note: The **MUST**'s in below explanations are due to how the generic Makefiles are setup, and is **NOT** a Xilinx tools requirement!
  - `[project-root]/ps_apps`: PS applications can easily be added by adding a sub-project for each in `[project-root]/ps_apps`.
    - Vitis will automatically package them and they will end up on the sd_card.
    - The `[PS Application].exe` (extension **MUST** be .exe) **MUST** end up in the `[project-root]/ps_apps` dir.
  - `[project-root]/ip`: Kernels can be added by just adding a sub-project in `[project-root]/ip`.
    - You will need to update the `[project-root]/vitis/src/system.cfg` file to setup the correct connections/clocks.
    - A `[kernel].xo` file **MUST** end up in the `[project-root]/ip` dir
    - An extra aie graph **MUST** be added in the `[project-root]/ip/aie` dir, the `[project-root]/ip/aie/Makefile` will need adaptations.
